## Final Assignment

1. Think of a literary-theoretical concept that interests you. It should be
similar to "quality", "sentiment," or "style" that we explored in the class.
For ideas browse Cuddon, J. A, and C. E Preston. [The Penguin Dictionary of
Literary Terms and Literary
Theory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4OAOue0b3VMUF9vczRNS1d5R0k/view?usp=sharing).
London: Penguin Books, 1999.

2. Create a *simple* model that would address the concept empirically, similar
to what we did with the grading exercise. Explain it in plain English in
several paragraphs.

3. Chose a corpus (at least 2-3 documents) with which you can experiment.

4. Write pseudo-code to implement your model.

5. The pseudo-code should form the basis of your program. Use the ideas from
the class to implement in Python.

6. Run the corpus through your code.

7. Reflect on your results. What cases are you not covering? What could have
done better? Has it yielded any interesting insights or surprises?
