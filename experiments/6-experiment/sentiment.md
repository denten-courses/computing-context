## Experiment 6: Explore the Sentiment Library

1. Using the technique we covered in the earlier lectures find the source code
for TextBlob's sentiment implementation.

2. Read and annotate the code. Submit the annotation in well-commented .ipynb

3. What is their model of "subjectivity" and "polarity"? Write it out in plain
English.

4. Can you see any problems / gaps / biases in the way these concepts are
implemented?
