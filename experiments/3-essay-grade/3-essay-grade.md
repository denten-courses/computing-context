## Challenge

Create an automatic essay grader.

## Experiment

As usual, start with writing a model in pseudo-code. Create at least three
parameters (sentence length variation, lexical diversity, etc.) for grading.
Come up with a reasonable way of averaging individual scores to give each essay
a grade on the scale of 1-100. Run the corpus of class essays through your
grader. Output the results to a .csv file (that should include scores along
each parameter and the averaged "total score" for each student). Create a
graphic visualizing score distributions for the class as a whole. Apply a curve
if necessary.

Your code comments should include a description of your model at
the beginning of the file. What assumptions or biases does it imply? Spot check
a few essays by hand (concentrate on the ones with really high and really low
grades). How does your automatic grader correspond to your intuitions about
these essays?

Submit your annotated .py files, your .csv results, and any associated graphics.
