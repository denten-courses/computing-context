Experiment 3: Hunting the Whale III

Your task is to improve the word frequency algorithm from [Hunting the Whale
II](https://github.com/xpmethod/dhnotes/blob/master/python/python-4.md#hunting-the-whale).

1. Rewrite using list comprehensions. What are the advantages and the disadvantages of
collapsing the main `for` loop into one line?

2. You may have noted that many of the most frequent words in the novel are
not very meaningful like `a, an, the, at`. Rewrite to filter out the most
common English words.

3. Research "stop words." What are they? What is the effect of discarding
punctuation, capitalization, and stop words?

4. Compare the top 100 to the bottom 100 most frequent words. What do they
tell you about the novel?
