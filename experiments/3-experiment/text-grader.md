## Experiment 3: Essay Grader

1. Operationalize the idea of "staleness of imagery" and "lack of precision"
from Orwell's essay in pseudo code. Come up with a 6-12 steps algorithm that
could capture some limited sense of "staleness" and "imprecision."

2. How could your heuristic be improved?

3. Which steps of the above pseudo-code do you know how to implement in code?

4. Which steps do you not?

5. Using at least three weighted and averaged parameters of "writing well" (on
the level of word, sentence, or paragraph) write a program that grades essays.
For example: we could use some mixture of richness of vocabulary, sentence
length, and paragraph length variation.

6. Run a few of your own essays through your grader and then compare with
grades you get from famous writers, novelists, or essayists. How do your essays stack
up against Orwell's, for example?

7. Critique your program. What does it get right? What blind spots or biases
does it have? How could it be improved?
