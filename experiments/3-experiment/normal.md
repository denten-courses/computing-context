## Experiment 3: Normalized Type--Token Ratio (TTR)

1. Explain your strategy for cleaning HTML. What are the strengths and
weaknesses of each method?

2. Modularize the code from the class notes into functions.

3. Make your python code into a script that accepts arguments from the command
line. I want our `normal.py` to expect a file input. Add some error handling.
Do something smart if no file is passed. Think of adding a rudimentary check
to see if the file is in plain text format already (or of you need to add
logic to strip HTML in Python).

4. Create pseudo code that replicates section 2.2.1 in the van Velzen paper.
We want to normalize for text length to be able to compare the TTR for two
texts of different lengths. What should our minimum text length be and why.

5. Write a program that outputs normalized TTR.

6. Run a few of your own texts through the machine along with Orwell and perhaps Moby Dick.
