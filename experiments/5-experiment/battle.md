## Experiment 5: Writers Battle

1. Rewrite our ARI algorithm as a function.

2. Rewrite as a script that takes a file name and outputs the ARI score.

3. Pick works by two authors from Project Gutenberg and compare them for
readability using our ARI algorithm.

4. Pick two passages from the same author and compare for readability. What
does it say about sample size?

5. Implement the [Gunning fog
index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning_fog_index).

6. Repeat #2 and #3. How do the two scales compare?
