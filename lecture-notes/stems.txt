that

it
is
the
imag

at

this

then
,
howev
the

may
order

about

howev
they
may

so
the

again
,
i
alway
go
to

becaus
they
make

there
is
all
the

the

of

is
perhap
the

,--
what

the

how

final
,
i
alway
go

sea
as
a

,
becaus
of
the
wholesom
exercis

pure
air
of
the

for
as

are
far
more
preval
than

from

(
that
is
,
if
you
never
violat

so
for
the
most
part
the
commodor
on
the
quarter

deck
get
his
atmospher
at
second
hand
from
the
sailor
on

.
he
think
he
breath
it

not
so

in

lead

at

that

littl

but
wherefor
it
was
that
after
have
repeat
smelt
the
sea
as
a
merchant
sailor
,
i
should
now
take
it
into
my

to
go
on
a

;
this
the

who
has

in

unaccount
way

he
can
better
answer
than
ani
one

and
,
doubtless
,
my
go
on
this
whale
voyag
,
form
part
of
the
grand
programm
of
provid
that
was
drawn
up
a
long
time
ago
.
it
came
in
as
a
sort
of
brief
interlud
and
solo
between
more
extens
perform
.
i
take
it
that
this
part
of
the
bill
must
have
run
someth
like
this
:
"

though
i
cannot
tell
whi
it
was
exact
that
those
stage
manag
,
the
fate
,
put
me
down
for
this
shabbi
part
of
a
whale
voyag
,
when
other
were
set
down
for
magnific

in
high

and
short

easi

in

jolli

though
i
cannot
tell
whi
this
was
exact
;
yet
,
now
that
i
recal
all
the
circumst

i
think
i
can
see
a
littl
into
the
spring
and
motiv
which
be
cun
present

me
under
various
disguis
,
induc
me
to
set

perform
the
part
i
did
,
besid
cajol
me
into
the
delus
that
it
was
a
choic
result
from
my
own
unbias
freewil
and
discrimin
judgment
.
chief
among
these
motiv
was
the
overwhelm
idea
of
the
great
whale
himself
.
such
a
portent
and
mysteri
monster
rous
all
my
curios
.
then
the
wild
and
distant
sea
where
he
roll
his
island
bulk
;
the
undeliver
,
nameless
peril
of
the
whale
;
these
,
with
all
the
attend
marvel
of
a
thousand
patagonian
sight
and
sound
,
help
to
sway
me
to
my
wish
.
with
other
men
,
perhap
,
such
thing
would
not
have
been
induc
;
but
as
for
me
,
i
am
torment
with
an
everlast
itch
for
thing
remot
.
i
love
to
sail
forbidden
sea
,
and
land
on
barbar
coast
.
not
ignor
what
is
good
,
i
am
quick
to
perceiv
a
horror
,
and
could
still
be
social
with
it
--
would
they
let
me
--
sinc
it
is
but
well
to
be
on
friend
term
with
all
the
inmat
of

by
reason
of
these
thing
,
then
,
the

was
welcom
;
the

open

in

i

with

so
on

went

i
now
by
instinct
follow
the
street

here

a

at

of
the

,
of
the

of

that
quarter
of

prove
all

but
present
i
came
to
a
smoki
light
proceed
from
a
low
,
wide
build
,
the
door
of
which
stood
invit
open
.
it
had
a
careless
look
,
as
if
it
were
meant
for
the
use
of
the
public
;
so
,
enter
,
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
stumbl
over
an
ash

box
in
the

.

this
,
then
must
need
be
the
sign
of
"

howev
,
i
pick
myself
up
and
hear
a
loud
voic
within
,
push
on
and
open
a
second
,
interior
door
.
it
seem
the
great
black
parliament
sit
in

.
a
hundr
black
face
turn
round
in
their
row
to
peer
;
and
beyond
,
a
black
angel
of
doom
was
beat
a
book
in
a
pulpit
.
it
was
a
negro
church
;
and
the
preacher
'

text
was
about
the
black
of
dark
,
and
the
weep
and
wail
and

there

move
on
,
i
at
last
came
to
a
dim
sort
of
light
not
far
from
the
dock
,
and
heard
a
forlorn
creak
in
the
air
;
and
look
up
,
saw
a
swing
sign
over
the
door
with
a
white
paint
upon
it
,
faint
repres
a
tall
straight
jet
of
misti
spray
,
and
these
word
underneath
--"

coffin
?--
spouter
?--
rather
omin
in
that
particular
connexion
,
thought
i
.
but
it
is
a
common
name
in
nantucket
,
they
say
,
and
i
suppos
this
peter
here
is
an
emigr
from
there
.
as
the
light
look
so
dim
,
and
the
place
,
for
the
time
,
look
quiet
enough
,
and
the
dilapid
littl
wooden
hous
itself
look
as
if
it
might
have
been
cart
here
from
the
ruin
of
some
burnt
district
,
and
as
the
swing
sign
had
a
poverti
-
stricken
sort
of
creak
to
it
,
i
thought
that
here
was
the
veri
spot
for
cheap
lodg
,
and
the
best
of
pea
coffe
.
it
was
a
queer
sort
of
place
--
a
gabl

end
old
hous
,
one
side
palsi
as
it
were
,
and
lean
over
sad
.
it
stood
on
a
sharp
bleak
corner
,
where
that
tempestu

euroclydon
kept
up
a
wors
howl
than
ever
it
did
about
poor

nevertheless
,

"

say
an

of

it

whether

it
'

the

chatter
his

against

,
and
shake
off
his

,
he
might
plug
up

,
and
put

yet
that

in

--(
he
had

afterward

pooh
,
pooh

what
a

;
how

let

what

?
can
he
warm
his

them
up

the
grand

?
would
not
lazarus
rather
be

would

yea

ye

!
go
down
to
the

itself
,
in

to
keep
out

?
now
,
that
lazarus
should
lie
strand
there
on
the
curbston
befor
the

of
dive
,
this
is
more
wonder
than
that
an

there

i

i
told
him

never

that
if
i
should
ever

so
,
it
would
depend

who

might
be
,
and
that
if
he

had
no

at

he
didn

i

at

some
four

of
us
were
summon

it

now

a
tramp
of
sea
boot
was
heard
in

entri
;
the

was
flung
open
,
and
in
roll

with
their
head
muffl
in
woollen
comfort
,
all
bedarn
and
rag
,
and
their
beard
stiff
with
icicl
,
they
seem
an
erupt
of
bear
from
labrador
.
they
had
just
land
from
their
boat
,
and
this
was
the
first
hous
they
enter
.
no
wonder
,
then
,
that
they
made
a
straight
wake
for
the
whale

s
mouth
--
the
bar
--
when
the
wrinkl
littl
old
jonah

there

all
round

one
complain
of
a
bad
cold
in
his
head
,
upon
which
jonah
mix
him
a
pitch
-
like
potion
of
gin
and
molass
,
which
he
swore
was
a
sovereign
cure
for
all
cold
and
catarrh
whatsoev
,
never
mind
of
how
long
stand
,
or
whether
caught
off
the
coast
of
labrador
,
or
on
the
weather
side
of
an
ice

island
.
the
liquor
soon
mount
into
their
head
,
as
it
general
doe
even
with
the
arrantest
toper
newli
land
from
sea
,
and
they
began
caper
about
most
obstreper
.
i
observ
,
howev
,
that
one
of
them
held
somewhat
aloof
,
and
though
he
seem
desir
not
to
spoil
the
hilar
of
his
shipmat
by
his
own
sober
face
,
yet
upon
the
whole
he
refrain
from
make
as
much
nois
as
the
rest
.
this
man
interest
me
at
onc
;
and
sinc
the
sea
-
god
had
ordain
that
he
should
soon
becom
my
shipmat
(
though
but
a
sleep
-
partner
one
,
so
far
as
this
narrat
is
concern
),
i
will
here
ventur
upon
a
littl
descript
of
him
.
he
stood
full
six
feet
in
height
,
with
nobl
shoulder
,
and
a
chest
like
a
coffer
-
dam
.
i
have
seldom
seen
such
brawn
in
a
man
.
his
face
was
deepli
brown
and
burnt
,
make
his
white
teeth
dazzl
by
the
contrast
;
while
in
the
deep
shadow
of
his
eye
float
some
reminisc
that
did
not
seem
to
give
him
much
joy
.
his
voic
at
onc
announc
that
he
was
a
southern
,
and
from
his
fine
statur
,
i
thought
he
must
be
one
of
those
tall
mountain
from
the
alleghanian
ridg
in
virginia
.
when
the
revelri
of
his
companion
had
mount
to
it
height
,
this
man
slip
away
unobserv
,
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
till
he
becam
my
comrad
on
the
sea
.
in
a
few
minut
,
howev
,
he
was
miss
by
his
shipmat
,
and
be
,
it
seem
,
for
some
reason
a
huge
favourit
with
them
,
they
rais
a
cri
of
"
bulkington
!
bulkington
!
where
'
s
bulkington
?"
and
dart
out
of
the
hous
in
pursuit
of
him
.
it
was
now
about
nine
o
'
clock
,
and
the
room
seem
almost
supernatur
quiet
after
these
orgi
,
i
began
to
congratul
myself
upon
a
littl
plan
that
had
occur
to
me
just
previous
to
the
entranc
of
the
seamen
.
no
man
prefer
to
sleep
two
in
a
bed
.
in
fact
,
you
would
a
good
deal
rather
not
sleep
with
your
own
brother
.
i
don
'
t
know
how
it
is
,
but
peopl
like
to
be
privat
when
they
are
sleep
.
and
when
it
come
to
sleep
with
an
unknown
stranger
,
in
a
strang
inn
,
in
a
strang
town
,
and
that
stranger
a
harpoon
,
then
your
object
indefinit
multipli
.
nor
was
there
ani
earth
reason
whi
i
as
a
sailor
should
sleep
two
in
a
bed
,
more
than
anybodi
els
;
for
sailor
no
more
sleep
two
in
a
bed
at
sea
,
than
bachelor
king
do
ashor
.
to
be
sure
they
all
sleep
togeth
in
one
apart
,
but
you
have
your
own
hammock
,
and
cover
yourself
with
your
own
blanket
,
and
sleep
in
your
own
skin
.
the
more
i
ponder
over
this
harpoon
,
the
more
i
abomin
the
thought
of
sleep
with
him
.
it
was
fair
to
presum
that
be
a
harpoon
,
his
linen
or
woollen
,
as
the
case
might
be
,
would
not
be
of
the
tidiest
,
certain
none
of
the
finest
.
i
began
to
twitch
all
over
.
besid
,
it
was
get
late
,
and
my
decent
harpoon
ought
to
be
home
and
go
bedward
.
suppos
now
,
he
should
tumbl
in
upon
me
at
midnight
--
how
could
i
tell
from
what
vile
hole
he
had
been
come
?
"
landlord
!
i
'
ve
chang
my
mind
about
that
harpoon
.--
i
shan
'
t
sleep
with
him
.
i
'
ll
tri
the
bench
here
."
"
just
as
you
pleas
;
i
'
m
sorri
i
cant
spare
ye
a
tablecloth
for
a
mattress
,
and
it
'
s
a
plaguy
rough
board
here
"--
feel
of
the
knot
and
notch
.
"
but
wait
a
bit
,
skrimshand
;
i
'
ve
got
a
carpent
'
s
plane
there
in
the
bar
--
wait
,
i
say
,
and
i
'
ll
make
ye
snug
enough
."
so
say
he
procur
the
plane
;
and
with
his
old
silk
handkerchief
first
dust
the
bench
,
vigor
set
to
plane
away
at
my
bed
,
the
while
grin
like
an
ape
.
the
shave
flew
right
and
left
;
till
at
last
the
plane
-
iron
came
bump
against
an
indestruct
knot
.
the
landlord
was
near
sprain
his
wrist
,
and
i
told
him
for
heaven
'
s
sake
to
quit
--
the
bed
was
soft
enough
to
suit
me
,
and
i
did
not
know
how
all
the
plane
in
the
world
could
make
eider
down
of
a
pine
plank
.
so
gather
up
the
shave
with
anoth
grin
,
and
throw
them
into
the
great
stove
in
the
middl
of
the
room
,
he
went
about
his
busi
,
and
left
me
in
a
brown
studi
.
i
now
took
the
measur
of
the
bench
,
and
found
that
it
was
a
foot
too
short
;
but
that
could
be
mend
with
a
chair
.
but
it
was
a
foot
too
narrow
,
and
the
other
bench
in
the
room
was
about
four
inch
higher
than
the
plane
one
--
so
there
was
no
yoke
them
.
i
then
place
the
first
bench
lengthwis
along
the
onli
clear
space
against
the
wall
,
leav
a
littl
interv
between
,
for
my
back
to
settl
down
in
.
but
i
soon
found
that
there
came
such
a
draught
of
cold
air
over
me
from
under
the
sill
of
the
window
,
that
this
plan
would
never
do
at
all
,
especi
as
anoth
current
from
the
ricketi
door
met
the
one
from
the
window
,
and
both
togeth
form
a
seri
of
small
whirlwind
in
the
immedi
vicin
of
the
spot
where
i
had
thought
to
spend
the
night
.
the
devil
fetch
that
harpoon
,
thought
i
,
but
stop
,
couldn
'
t
i
steal
a
march
on
him
--
bolt
his
door
insid
,
and
jump
into
his
bed
,
not
to
be
waken
by
the
most
violent
knock
?
it
seem
no
bad
idea
;
but
upon
second
thought
i
dismiss
it
.
for
who
could
tell
but
what
the
next
morn
,
so
soon
as
i
pop
out
of
the
room
,
the
harpoon
might
be
stand
in
the
entri
,
all
readi
to
knock
me
down
!
still
,
look
round
me
again
,
and
see
no
possibl
chanc
of
spend
a
suffer
night
unless
in
some
other
person
'
s
bed
,
i
began
to
think
that
after
all
i
might
be
cherish
unwarrant
prejudic
against
this
unknown
harpoon
.
think
i
,
i
'
ll
wait
awhil
;
he
must
be
drop
in
befor
long
.
i
'
ll
have
a
good
look
at
him
then
,
and
perhap
we
may
becom
jolli
good
bedfellow
after
all
--
there
'
s
no
tell
.
but
though
the
other
boarder
kept
come
in
by
one
,
twos
,
and
three
,
and
go
to
bed
,
yet
no
sign
of
my
harpoon

"

said
i
,
"

it
was
now
hard
upon

the
landlord
chuckl
again
with
his
lean
chuckl
,
and
seem
to
be
mightili
tickl
at
someth
beyond
my
comprehens

"

'

;"
and
so
say
he
light
a
candl
and
held
it
toward
me
,
offer
to
lead
the
way
.
but
i
stood
irresolut
;
when
look
at
a
clock
in
the
corner
,
he
exclaim
"
i
vum
it
'
s
sunday
--
you

'
t
see

he

--
come
along
then
;
do
come
;
won
'
t
ye
come
?"
i
consid
the
matter
a
moment
,
and
then
up
stair
we
went
,
and
i
was
usher
into
a
small
room
,
cold
as
a
clam
,
and
furnish
,
sure
enough
,
with
a
prodigi
bed
,
almost
big
enough
inde
for
ani
four
harpoon
to
sleep
abreast
.
"
there
,"
said
the
landlord
,
place
the
candl
on
a
crazi
old
sea
chest
that
did
doubl
duti
as
a
wash
-
stand
and
centr
tabl
;
"
there
,
make
yourself
comfort
now
,
and
good
night
to
ye
."
i
turn
round
from
eye
the
bed
,
but
he
had
disappear
.
fold
back
the
counterpan
,
i
stoop
over
the
bed
.
though
none
of
the
most
eleg
,
it
yet
stood
the
scrutini
toler
well
.
i
then
glanc
round
the
room
;
and
besid
the
bedstead
and
centr
tabl
,
could
see
no
other
furnitur
belong
to
the
place
,
but
a
rude
shelf
,
the
four
wall
,
and
a
paper
fireboard
repres
a
man
strike
a
whale
.
of
thing
not
proper
belong
to
the
room
,
there
was
a
hammock
lash
up
,
and
thrown
upon
the
floor
in
one
corner
;
also
a
larg
seaman
'
s
bag
,
contain
the
harpoon
'
s
wardrob
,
no
doubt
in
lieu
of
a
land
trunk
.
likewis
,
there
was
a
parcel
of
outlandish
bone
fish
hook
on
the
shelf
over
the
fire
-
place
,
and
a
tall
harpoon
stand
at
the
head
of
the
bed
.
but
what
is
this
on
the
chest
?
i
took
it
up
,
and
held
it
close
to
the
light
,
and
felt
it
,
and
smelt
it
,
and
tri
everi
way
possibl
to
arriv
at
some
satisfactori
conclus
concern
it
.
i
can
compar
it
to
noth
but
a
larg
door
mat
,
ornament
at
the
edg
with
littl
tinkl
tag
someth
like
the
stain
porcupin
quill
round
an
indian
moccasin
.
there
was
a
hole
or
slit
in
the
middl
of
this
mat
,
as
you
see
the
same
in
south
american
poncho
.
but
could
it
be
possibl
that
ani
sober
harpoon
would
get
into
a
door
mat
,
and
parad
the
street
of
ani
christian
town
in
that
sort
of
guis
?
i
put
it
on
,
to
tri
it
,
and
it
weigh
me
down
like
a
hamper
,
be
uncommon
shaggi
and
thick
,
and
i
thought
a
littl
damp
,
as
though
this
mysteri
harpoon
had
been
wear
it
of
a
raini
day
.
i
went
up
in
it
to
a
bit
of
glass
stuck
against
the
wall
,
and
i
never
saw
such
a
sight
in
my
life
.
i
tore
myself
out
of
it
in
such
a
hurri
that
i
gave
myself
a
kink
in
the
neck
.
i
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
,
and
commenc
think
about
this
head
-
peddl
harpoon
,
and
his
door
mat
.
after
think
some
time
on
the
bed
-
side
,
i
got
up
and
took
off
my
monkey
jacket
,
and
then
stood
in
the
middl
of
the
room
think
.
i
then
took
off
my
coat
,
and
thought
a
littl
more
in
my
shirt
sleev
.
but
begin
to
feel
veri
cold
now
,
half
undress
as
i
was
,
and
rememb
what
the
landlord
said
about
the
harpoon
'
s
not
come
home
at
all
that
night
,
it
be
so
veri
late
,
i
made
no
more
ado
,
but
jump
out
of
my
pantaloon
and
boot
,
and
then
blow
out
the
light
tumbl
into
bed
,
and
commend
myself
to
the
care
of
heaven
.
whether
that
mattress
was
stuf
with
corn
-
cob
or
broken
crockeri
,
there
is
no
tell
,
but
i
roll
about
a
good
deal
,
and
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
.
at
last
i
slid
off
into
a
light
doze
,
and
had
pretti
near
made
a
good
of
toward
the
land
of
nod
,
when
i
heard
a
heavi
footfal
in
the
passag
,
and
saw
a
glimmer
of
light
come
into
the
room
from
under
the
door
.
lord
save
me
,
think
i
,
that
must
be
the
harpoon
,
the
infern
head
-
peddler
.
but
i
lay
perfect
still
,
and
resolv
not
to
say
a
word
till
spoken
to
.
hold
a
light
in
one
hand
,
and
that
ident
new
zealand
head
in
the
other
,
the
stranger
enter
the
room
,
and
without
look
toward
the
bed
,
place
his
candl
a
good
way
off
from
me
on
the
floor
in
one
corner
,
and
then
began
work
away
at
the
knot
cord
of
the
larg
bag
i
befor
spoke
of
as
be
in
the
room
.
i
was
all
eager
to
see
his
face
,
but
he
kept
it
avert
for
some
time
while
employ
in
unlac
the
bag
'
s
mouth
.
this
accomplish
,
howev
,
he
turn
round
--
when
,
good
heaven
!
what
a
sight
!
such
a
face
!
it
was
of
a
dark
,
purplish
,
yellow
colour
,
here
and
there
stuck
over
with
larg
blackish
look
squar
.
yes
,
it
'
s
just
as
i
thought
,
he
'
s
a
terribl
bedfellow
;
he
'
s
been
in
a
fight
,
got
dread
cut
,
and
here
he
is
,
just
from
the
surgeon
.
but
at
that
moment
he
chanc
to
turn
his
face
so
toward
the
light
,
that
i
plain
saw
they
could
not
be
stick
-
plaster
at
all
,
those
black
squar
on
his
cheek
.
they
were
stain
of
some
sort
or
other
.
at
first
i
knew
not
what
to
make
of
this
;
but
soon
an
inkl
of
the
truth
occur
to
me
.
i
rememb
a
stori
of
a
white
man
--
a
whaleman
too
--
who
,
fall
among
the
cannib
,
had
been
tattoo
by
them
.
i
conclud
that
this
harpoon
,
in
the
cours
of
his
distant
voyag
,
must
have
met
with
a
similar
adventur
.
and
what
is
it
,
thought
i
,
after
all
!
it
'
s
onli
his
outsid
;
a
man
can
be
honest
in
ani
sort
of
skin
.
but
then
,
what
to
make
of
his
unearth
complexion
,
that
part
of
it
,
i
mean
,
lie
round
about
,
and
complet
independ
of
the
squar
of
tattoo
.
to
be
sure
,
it
might
be
noth
but
a
good
coat
of
tropic
tan
;
but
i
never
heard
of
a
hot
sun
'
s
tan
a
white
man
into
a
purplish
yellow
one
.
howev
,
i
had
never
been
in
the
south
sea
;
and
perhap
the
sun
there
produc
these
extraordinari
effect
upon
the
skin
.
now
,
while
all
these
idea
were
pass
through
me
like
lightn
,
this
harpoon
never
notic
me
at
all
.
but
,
after
some
difficulti
have
open
his
bag
,
he
commenc
fumbl
in
it
,
and
present
pull
out
a
sort
of
tomahawk
,
and
a
seal
-
skin
wallet
with
the
hair
on
.
place
these
on
the
old
chest
in
the
middl
of
the
room
,
he
then
took
the
new
zealand
head
--
a
ghast
thing
enough
--
and
cram
it
down
into
the
bag
.
he
now
took
off
his
hat
--
a
new
beaver
hat
--
when
i
came
nigh
sing
out
with
fresh
surpris
.
there
was
no
hair
on
his
head
--
none
to
speak
of
at
least
--
noth
but
a
small
scalp
-
knot
twist
up
on
his
forehead
.
his
bald
purplish
head
now
look
for
all
the
world
like
a
mildew
skull
.
had
not
the
stranger
stood
between
me
and
the
door
,
i
would
have
bolt
out
of
it
quicker
than
ever
i
bolt
a
dinner
.
even
as
it
was
,
i
thought
someth
of
slip
out
of
the
window
,
but
it
was
the
second
floor
back
.
i
am
no
coward
,
but
what
to
make
of
this
head
-
peddl
purpl
rascal
altogeth
pass
my
comprehens
.
ignor
is
the
parent
of
fear
,
and
be
complet
nonpluss
and
confound
about
the
stranger
,
i
confess
i
was
now
as
much
afraid
of
him
as
if
it
was
the
devil
himself
who
had
thus
broken
into
my
room
at
the
dead
of
night
.
in
fact
,
i
was
so
afraid
of
him
that
i
was
not
game
enough
just
then
to
address
him
,
and
demand
a
satisfactori
answer
concern
what
seem
inexplic
in
him
.
meanwhil
,
he
continu
the
busi
of
undress
,
and
at
last
show
his
chest
and
arm
.
as
i
live
,
these
cover
part
of
him
were
checker
with
the
same
squar
as
his
face
;
his
back
,
too
,
was
all
over
the
same
dark
squar
;
he
seem
to
have
been
in
a
thirti
year
'
war
,
and
just
escap
from
it
with
a
stick
-
plaster
shirt
.
still
more
,
his
veri
leg
were
mark
,
as
if
a
parcel
of
dark
green
frog
were
run
up
the
trunk
of
young
palm
.
it
was
now
quit
plain
that
he
must
be
some
abomin
savag
or
other
ship
aboard
of
a
whaleman
in
the
south
sea
,
and
so
land
in
this
christian
countri
.
i
quak
to
think
of
it
.
a
peddler
of
head
too
--
perhap
the
head
of
his
own
brother
.
he
might
take
a
fanci
to
mine
--
heaven
!
look
at
that
tomahawk
!
but
there
was
no
time
for
shudder
,
for
now
the
savag
went
about
someth
that
complet
fascin
my
attent
,
and
convinc
me
that
he
must
inde
be
a
heathen
.
go
to
his
heavi
grego
,
or
wrapal
,
or
dreadnaught
,
which
he
had
previous
hung
on
a
chair
,
he
fumbl
in
the
pocket
,
and
produc
at
length
a
curious
littl
deform
imag
with
a
hunch
on
it
back
,
and
exact
the
colour
of
a
three
day
'
old
congo
babi
.
rememb
the
embalm
head
,
at
first
i
almost
thought
that
this
black
manikin
was
a
real
babi
preserv
in
some
similar
manner
.
but
see
that
it
was
not
at
all
limber
,
and
that
it
glisten
a
good
deal
like
polish
eboni
,
i
conclud
that
it
must
be
noth
but
a
wooden
idol
,
which
inde
it
prove
to
be
.
for
now
the
savag
goe
up
to
the
empti
fire
-
place
,
and
remov
the
paper
fire
-
board
,
set
up
this
littl
hunch
-
back
imag
,
like
a
tenpin
,
between
the
andiron
.
the
chimney
jamb
and
all
the
brick
insid
were
veri
sooti
,
so
that
i
thought
this
fire
-
place
made
a
veri
appropri
littl
shrine
or
chapel
for
his
congo
idol
.
i
now
screw
my
eye
hard
toward
the
half
hidden
imag
,
feel
but
ill
at
eas
meantim
--
to
see
what
was
next
to
follow
.
first
he
take
about
a
doubl
hand
of
shave
out
of
his
grego
pocket
,
and
place
them
care
befor
the
idol
;
then
lay
a
bit
of
ship
biscuit
on
top
and
appli
the
flame
from
the
lamp
,
he
kindl
the
shave
into
a
sacrifici
blaze
.
present
,
after
mani
hasti
snatch
into
the
fire
,
and
still
hastier
withdraw
of
his
finger
(
wherebi
he
seem
to
be
scorch
them
bad
),
he
at
last
succeed
in
draw
out
the
biscuit
;
then
blow
off
the
heat
and
ash
a
littl
,
he
made
a
polit
offer
of
it
to
the
littl
negro
.
but
the
littl
devil
did
not
seem
to
fanci
such
dri
sort
of
fare
at
all
;
he
never
move
his
lip
.
all
these
strang
antic
were
accompani
by
still
stranger
guttur
nois
from
the
devote
,
who
seem
to
be
pray
in
a
sing
-
song
or
els
sing
some
pagan
psalmodi
or
other
,
dure
which
his
face
twitch
about
in
the
most
unnatur
manner
.
at
last
extinguish
the
fire
,
he
took
the
idol
up
veri
unceremoni
,
and
bag
it
again
in
his
grego
pocket
as
careless
as
if
he
were
a
sportsman
bag
a
dead
woodcock
.
all
these
queer
proceed
increas
my
uncomfort
,
and
see
him
now
exhibit
strong
symptom
of
conclud
his
busi
oper
,
and
jump
into
bed
with
me
,
i
thought
it
was
high
time
,
now
or
never
,
befor
the
light
was
put
out
,
to
break
the
spell
in
which
i
had
so
long
been
bound
.
but
the
interv
i
spent
in
deliber
what
to
say
,
was
a
fatal
one
.
take
up
his
tomahawk
from
the
tabl
,
he
examin
the
head
of
it
for
an
instant
,
and
then
hold
it
to
the
light
,
with
his
mouth
at
the
handl
,
he
puf
out
great
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
.
the
next
moment
the
light
was
extinguish
,
and
this
wild
cannib
,
tomahawk
between
his
teeth
,
sprang
into
bed
with
me
.
i
sang
out
,
i
could
not
help
it
now
;
and
give
a
sudden
grunt
of
astonish
he
began
feel
me
.
stammer
out
someth
,
i
knew
not
what
,
i
roll
away
from
him
against
the
wall
,
and
then
conjur
him
,
whoever
or
whatev
he
might
be
,
to
keep
quiet
,
and
let
me
get
up
and
light
the
lamp
again
.
but
his
guttur
respons
satisfi
me
at
onc
that
he
but
ill
comprehend
my
mean
.
"
who
-
e
debel
you
?"--
he
at
last
said
--"
you
no
speak
-
e
,
dam
-
me
,
i
kill
-
e
."
and
so
say
the
light
tomahawk
began
flourish
about
me
in
the
dark
.
"
landlord
,
for
god
'
s
sake
,
peter
coffin
!"
shout
i
.
"
landlord
!
watch
!

!

!
save

!"
"
speak

tell
-
ee
me
who

ee

,
or
dam
-
me
,
i
kill

!"
again
growl
the
cannib
,
while
his
horrid
flourish
of
the
tomahawk
scatter
the
hot
tobacco
ash
about
me
till
i
thought
my
linen
would
get
on
fire
.
but
thank
heaven
,
at
that
moment
the
landlord
came
into
the
room
light
in
hand
,
and
leap
from
the
bed
i
ran
up
to
him
.
"
don
'
t
be
afraid
now
,"
said
he
,
grin
again
,
"
queequeg
here
wouldn
'
t
harm
a
hair
of
your
head
."
"
stop
your
grin
,"
shout
i
,
"
and
whi
didn
'
t
you
tell
me
that
that
infern
harpoon

"
i
thought

d
it
;--
didn
'
t
i
tell

,

was

head
around

?--
but
turn
fluke
again
and
go
to
sleep
.
queequeg
,
look
here
--

,
i
sabbe

the
counterpan
.
upon
wake
next
morn
about
daylight
,
i
found
queequeg
'
s
arm
thrown
over
me
in
the
most
love
and
affection
manner
.
you
had
almost
thought
i
had
been
his
wife
.
the
counterpan
was
of
patchwork
,
full
of
odd
littl
parti
-
colour
squar
and
triangl
;
and
this
arm
of
his
tattoo
all
over
with
an
intermin
cretan
labyrinth
of
a
figur
,
no

part
of
which
were
of
one
precis

keep
his
arm
at
sea
unmethod
in

and
shade
,
his
shirt

irregular
roll
up
at
various
time
--
this
same
arm
of
his
,
i
say
,
look
for
all
the
world
like
a
strip
of
that
same
patchwork
quilt
.
inde
,
part
lie
on
it
as
the
arm
did
when
i
first
awok
,
i
could
hard
tell
it
from
the
quilt
,
they
so
blend
their
hue
togeth
;
and
it
was
onli
by
the
sens
of
weight
and
pressur
that
i
could
tell
that
queequeg
was
hug
me
.
my
sensat
were
strang
.
let
me
tri
to
explain
them
.
when
i
was
a
child
,
i
well
rememb
a
somewhat
similar
circumst
that
befel
me
;
whether
it
was
a
realiti
or
a
dream
,
i
never
could
entir
settl
.
the
circumst
was
this
.
i
had
been
cut
up
some
caper
or
other
--
i
think
it
was
tri
to
crawl
up
the
chimney
,
as
i
had
seen
a
littl
sweep
do
a
few
day
previous
;
and
my
stepmoth
who
,
somehow
or
other
,
was
all
the
time
whip
me
,
or
send
me
to
bed
supperless
,--
my
mother
drag
me
by
the
leg
out
of
the
chimney
and
pack
me
off
to
bed
,
though
it
was
onli
two
o
'
clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
21st
june
,
the
longest
day
in
the
year
in
our
hemispher
.
i
felt
dread
.
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
,
so
up
stair
i
went
to
my
littl
room
in
the
third
floor
,
undress
myself
as
slowli
as
possibl
so
as
to
kill
time
,
and
with
a
bitter
sigh
got
between
the
sheet
.
i
lay
there
dismal
calcul
that
sixteen
entir
hour
must
elaps
befor
i
could
hope
for
a
resurrect
.
sixteen
hour
in
bed
!
the
small
of
my
back
ach
to
think
of
it
.
and
it
was
so
light
too
;
the
sun
shine
in
at
the
window
,
and
a
great
rattl
of
coach
in
the
street
,
and
the
sound
of
gay
voic
all
over
the
hous
.
i
felt
wors
and
wors
--
at
last
i
got
up
,
dress
,
and
soft
go
down
in
my
stocking
feet
,
sought
out
my
stepmoth
,
and
sudden
threw
myself
at
her
feet
,
beseech
her
as
a
particular
favour
to
give
me
a
good
slipper
for
my
misbehaviour
;
anyth
inde
but
condemn
me
to
lie
abe
such
an
unendur
length
of
time
.
but
she
was
the
best
and
most
conscienti
of
stepmoth
,
and
back
i
had
to
go
to
my
room
.
for
sever
hour
i
lay
there
broad
awak
,
feel
a
great
deal
wors
than
i
have
ever
done
sinc
,
even
from
the
greatest
subsequ
misfortun
.
at
last
i
must
have
fallen
into
a
troubl
nightmar
of
a
doze
;
and
slowli
wake
from
it
--
half
steep
in
dream
--
i
open
my
eye
,
and
the
befor
sun
-
lit
room
was
now
wrap
in
outer
dark
.
instant
i
felt
a
shock
run
through
all
my
frame
;
noth
was
to
be
seen
,
and
noth
was
to
be
heard
;
but
a
supernatur
hand
seem
place
in
mine
.
my
arm
hung
over
the
counterpan
,
and
the
nameless
,
unimagin
,
silent
form
or
phantom
,
to
which
the
hand
belong
,
seem
close
seat
by
my
bed
-
side
.
for
what
seem
age
pile
on
age
,
i
lay
there
,
frozen
with
the
most
aw
fear
,
not
dare
to
drag
away
my
hand
;
yet
ever
think
that
if
i
could
but
stir
it
one
singl
inch
,
the
horrid
spell
would
be
broken
.
i
knew
not
how
this
conscious
at
last
glide
away
from
me
;
but
wake
in
the
morn
,
i
shudder
rememb
it
all
,
and
for
day
and
week
and
month
afterward
i
lost
myself
in
confound
attempt
to
explain
the
mysteri
.
nay
,
to
this
veri
hour
,
i
often
puzzl
myself
with
it
.
now
,
take
away
the
aw
fear
,
and
my
sensat
at
feel
the
supernatur
hand
in
mine
were
veri
similar
,
in
their
strang
,
to
those
which
i
experienc
on
wake
up
and
see
queequeg
'
s
pagan
arm
thrown
round
me
.
but
at
length
all
the
past
night
'
s
event
sober
recur
,
one
by
one
,
in
fix
realiti
,
and
then
i
lay
onli
aliv
to
the
comic
predica
.
for
though
i
tri
to
move
his
arm
--
unlock
his
bridegroom
clasp
--
yet
,
sleep
as
he
was
,
he
still
hug
me
tight
,
as
though
naught
but
death
should
part
us
twain
.
i
now
strove
to
rous
him
--"
queequeg
!"--
but
his
onli
answer
was
a
snore
.
i
then
roll
over
,
my
neck
feel
as
if
it
were
in
a
hors
-
collar
;
and
sudden
felt
a
slight
scratch
.
throw
asid
the
counterpan
,
there
lay
the
tomahawk
sleep
by
the
savag
'
s
side
,
as
if
it
were

a

thought
i
;
abe
here
in
a
strang
hous
in
the
broad
day
,
with
a
cannib
and
a
tomahawk
!
"
queequeg
!--
in
the
name
of

queequeg
,

at
length
,
by
dint
of
much
wriggl
,
and
loud
and
incess
expostul
upon
the
unbecoming
of
his
hug
a
fellow
male
in
that
matrimoni
sort
of
style
,
i
succeed
in
extract
a
grunt
;
and
present
,
he
drew
back
his
arm
,
shook
himself
all
over
like
a
newfoundland
dog
just
from
the
water
,
and
sat
up
in
bed
,
stiff
as
a
pike
-
staff
,
look
at
me
,
and
rub
his
eye
as
if
he
did
not
altogeth
rememb
how
i
came
to
be
there
,
though
a
dim
conscious
of
know
someth
about
me
seem
slowli
dawn
over
him
.
meanwhil
,
i
lay
quiet
eye
him
,
have
no
serious
misgiv
now
,
and
bent
upon
narrowli
observ
so
curious
a
creatur
.
when
,
at
last
,
his
mind
seem
made
up
touch
the
charact
of
his
bedfellow
,
and
he
becam
,
as
it
were
,
reconcil
to
the
fact
;
he
jump
out
upon
the
floor
,
and
by
certain
sign
and
sound
gave
me
to
understand
that
,
if
it
pleas
me
,
he
would
dress
first
and
then
leav
me
to
dress
afterward
,
leav
the
whole
apart
to
myself
.
think
i
,
queequeg
,
under
the
circumst
,
this
is
a
veri
civil
overtur
;
but
,
the
truth
is
,
these
savag
have
an
innat
sens
of
delicaci
,
say
what
you
will
;
it
is
marvel
how
essenti
polit
they
are
.
i
pay
this
particular
compliment
to
queequeg
,
becaus
he
treat
me
with
so
much
civil
and
consider
,
while
i
was
guilti
of
great
rude
;
stare
at
him
from
the
bed
,
and
watch
all
his
toilett
motion
;
for
the
time
my
curios
get
the
better
of
my
breed
.
nevertheless
,
a
man
like
queequeg
you
don
'
t
see
everi
day
,
he
and
his
way
were
well
worth
unusu
regard
.
he
commenc
dress
at
top
by
don
his
beaver
hat
,
a
veri
tall
one
,
by
the
by
,
and
then
--
still
minus
his
trowser
--
he
hunt
up
his
boot
.
what
under
the
heaven
he
did
it
for
,
i
cannot
tell
,
but
his
next
movement
was
to
crush
himself
--
boot
in
hand
,
and
hat
on
--
under
the
bed
;
when
,
from
sundri
violent
gasp
and
strain
,
i
infer
he
was
hard
at
work
boot
himself
;
though
by
no
law
of
proprieti
that
i
ever
heard
of
,
is
ani
man
requir
to
be
privat
when
put
on
his
boot
.
but
queequeg
,
do
you
see
,
was
a
creatur
in
the
transit
stage
--
neither
caterpillar
nor
butterfli
.
he
was
just
enough
civil
to
show
off
his
outlandish
in
the
strangest
possibl
manner
.
his
educ
was
not
yet
complet
.
he
was
an
undergradu
.
if
he
had
not
been
a
small
degre
civil
,
he
veri
probabl
would
not
have
troubl
himself
with
boot
at
all
;
but
then
,
if
he
had
not
been
still
a
savag
,
he
never
would
have
dreamt
of
get
under
the
bed
to
put
them
on
.
at
last
,
he
emerg
with
his
hat
veri
much
dent
and
crush
down
over
his
eye
,
and
began
creak
and
limp
about
the
room
,
as
if
,
not
be
much
accustom
to
boot
,
his
pair
of
damp
,
wrinkl
cowhid
one
--
probabl
not
made
to
order
either
--
rather
pinch
and
torment
him
at
the
first
go
off
of
a
bitter
cold
morn
.
see
,
now
,
that
there
were
no
curtain
to
the
window
,
and
that
the
street
be
veri
narrow
,
the
hous
opposit
command
a
plain
view
into
the
room
,
and
observ
more
and
more
the
indecor
figur
that
queequeg
made
,
stave
about
with
littl
els
but
his
hat
and
boot
on
;
i
beg
him
as
well
as
i
could
,
to
acceler
his
toilet
somewhat
,
and
particular
to
get
into
his
pantaloon
as
soon
as
possibl
.
he
compli
,
and
then
proceed
to
wash
himself
.
at
that
time
in
the
morn
ani
christian
would
have
wash
his
face
;
but
queequeg
,
to
my
amaz
,
content
himself
with
restrict
his
ablut
to
his
chest
,
arm
,
and
hand
.
he
then
don
his
waistcoat
,
and
take
up
a
piec
of
hard
soap
on
the
wash
-
stand
centr
tabl
,
dip
it
into
water
and
commenc
lather
his
face
.
i
was
watch
to
see
where
he
kept
his
razor
,
when
lo
and
behold
,
he
take
the
harpoon
from
the
bed
corner
,
slip
out
the
long
wooden
stock
,
unsheath
the
head
,
whet
it
a
littl
on
his
boot
,
and
stride
up
to
the
bit
of
mirror
against
the
wall
,
begin
a
vigor
scrape
,
or
rather
harpoon
of
his
cheek
.
think
i
,
queequeg
,
this
is
use
roger
'
s
best
cutleri
with
a
vengeanc
.
afterward
i
wonder
the
less
at
this
oper
when
i
came
to
know
of
what
fine
steel
the
head
of
a
harpoon
is
made
,
and
how
exceed
sharp
the
long
straight
edg
are
alway
kept
.
the
rest
of
his
toilet
was
soon
achiev
,
and
he
proud
march
out
of
the
room
,
wrap
up
in
his
great
pilot
monkey
jacket
,
and
sport
his
harpoon
like

the

to

in

it
is
a

also

of

made
all

again
he
lean
over

bow
his

lowli

with
an
aspect

,
i
found
queequeg
there
quit
alon
;
he
have
left
the
chapel
befor
the
benedict
some
time
.
he
was
sit
on
a
bench
befor
the
fire
,
with
his
feet
on
the
stove
hearth
,
and
in
one
hand
was
hold
close
up
to
his
face
that
littl
negro
idol
of
his
;
peer
hard
into
it
face
,
and
with
a
jack
-
knife
gentl
whittl
away
at
it
nose
,
meanwhil
hum
to
himself
in
his
heathenish
way
.
but
be
now
interrupt
,
he
put
up
the
imag
;
and
pretti
soon
,
go
to
the
tabl
,
took
up
a
larg
book
there
,
and
place
it
on
his
lap
began
count
the
page
with
deliber
regular
;
at
everi
fiftieth
page
--
as
i
fanci
--
stop
a
moment
,
look
vacant
around
him
,
and
give
utter
to
a
long
-
drawn
gurgl
whistl
of
astonish
.
he
would
then
begin
again
at
the
next
fifti
;
seem
to
commenc
at
number
one
each
time
,
as
though
he
could
not
count
more
than
fifti
,
and
it
was
onli
by
such
a
larg
number
of
fifti
be
found
togeth
,
that
his
astonish
at
the
multitud
of
page
was
excit
.
with
much
interest
i
sat
watch
him
.
savag
though
he
was
,
and
hideous
mar
about
the
face
--
at
least
to
my
tast
--
his
counten
yet
had
a
someth
in
it
which
was
by
no
mean
disagre
.
you
cannot
hide
the
soul
.
through
all
his
unearth
tattoo
,
i
thought
i
saw
the
trace
of
a
simpl
honest
heart
;
and
in
his
larg
,
deep
eye
,
fieri
black
and
bold
,
there
seem
token
of
a
spirit
that
would
dare
a
thousand
devil
.
and
besid
all
this
,
there
was
a
certain
lofti
bear
about
the
pagan
,
which
even
his
uncouth
could
not
altogeth
maim
.
he
look
like
a
man
who
had
never
cring
and
never
had
had
a
creditor
.
whether
it
was
,
too
,
that
his
head
be
shave
,
his
forehead
was
drawn
out
in
freer
and
brighter
relief
,
and
look
more
expans
than
it
otherwis
would
,
this
i
will
not
ventur
to
decid
;
but
certain
it
was
his
head
was
phrenolog
an
excel
one
.
it
may
seem
ridicul
,
but
it
remind
me
of
general
washington
'
s
head
,
as
seen
in
the
popular
bust
of
him
.
it
had
the
same
long
regular
grade
retreat
slope
from
abov
the
brow
,
which
were
likewis

,
like

,
he
never

my
presenc
,
never
troubl
himself
with
so
much
as
a
singl
glanc
;
but
appear
wholli

count
the

of
the

book

consid
how
sociabl
we
had
been
sleep
togeth
the
night
previous
,
and
especi
consid
the
affection
arm
i
had
found
thrown
over
me
upon
wake
in
the
morn
,
i
thought
this
indiffer
of
his
veri
strang
.
but
savag
are
strang
be
;
at
time
you
do
not
know
exact
how
to
take
them
.
at
first
they
are
overaw
;
their
calm
self
-
collected
of
simplic
seem
a
socrat
wisdom
.
i
had
notic
also
that
queequeg
never
consort
at
all
,
or
but
veri
littl
,
with
the
other
seamen
in
the
inn
.
he
made
no
advanc
whatev
;
appear
to
have
no
desir
to
enlarg
the
circl
of
his
acquaint
.
all
this
struck
me
as
mighti
singular
;
yet
,
upon
second
thought
,
there
was
someth
almost
sublim
in
it
.
here
was
a
man
some
twenti
thousand
mile
from
home
,
by
the
way
of
cape
horn
,
that
is
--
which
was
the
onli
way
he
could
get
there
--
thrown
among
peopl
as
strang
to
him
as
though
he
were
in
the
planet
jupit
;
and
yet
he
seem
entir
at
his
eas
;
preserv
the
utmost
seren
;
content
with
his
own
companionship
;
alway
equal
to
himself
.
sure
this
was
a
touch
of
fine
philosophi
;
though
no
doubt
he
had
never
heard
there
was
such
a
thing
as
that
.
but
,
perhap
,
to
be
true
philosoph
,
we
mortal
should
not
be
conscious
of
so
live
or
so
strive
.
so
soon
as
i
hear
that
such
or
such
a
man
give
himself
out
for
a
philosoph
,
i
conclud
that
,
like
the
dyspept
old
woman
,
he
must
have
"
broken
his
digest
."
as
i
sat
there
in
that
now
lone
room
;
the
fire
burn
low
,
in
that
mild
stage
when
,
after
it
first
intens
has
warm
the
air
,
it
then
onli
glow
to
be
look
at
;
the
even
shade
and
phantom
gather
round
the
casement
,
and
peer
in
upon
us
silent
,
solitari
twain
;
the
storm
boom
without
in
solemn
swell
;
i
began
to
be
sensibl
of
strang
feel
.
i
felt
a
melt
in
me
.
no
more
my
splinter
heart
and
madden
hand
were
turn
against
the
wolfish
world
.
this
sooth
savag
had
redeem
it
.
there
he
sat
,
his
veri
indiffer
speak
a
natur
in
which
there
lurk
no
civil
hypocrisi
and
bland
deceit
.
wild
he
was
;
a
veri
sight
of
sight
to
see
;
yet
i
began
to
feel
myself
mysteri
drawn
toward
him
.
and
those
same
thing
that
would
have
repel
most
other
,
they
were
the
veri
magnet
that
thus
drew
me
.
i
'
ll
tri
a
pagan
friend
,
thought
i
,
sinc
christian
kind
has
prove
but
hollow
courtesi
.
i
drew
my
bench
near
him
,
and
made
some
friend
sign
and
hint
,
do
my
best
to
talk
with
him
meanwhil
.
at
first
he
littl
notic
these
advanc
;
but
present
,
upon
my
refer
to
his
last
night
'
s
hospit
,
he
made
out
to
ask
me
whether
we
were
again
to
be
bedfellow
.
i
told
him
yes
;
whereat
i
thought
he
look
pleas
,
perhap
a
littl
compliment
.
we
then
turn
over
the
book
togeth
,
and
i
endeavor
to
explain
to
him
the
purpos
of
the
print
,
and
the
mean
of
the
few
pictur
that
were
in
it
.
thus
i
soon
engag
his
interest
;
and
from
that
we
went
to
jabber
the
best
we
could
about
the
various
outer
sight
to
be
seen
in
this
famous
town
.
soon
i
propos
a
social
smoke
;
and
,
produc
his
pouch
and
tomahawk
,
he
quiet
offer
me
a
puff
.
and
then
we
sat
exchang
puff
from
that
wild
pipe
of
his
,
and
keep
it
regular
pass
between
us
.
if
there
yet
lurk
ani
ice
of
indiffer
toward
me
in
the
pagan
'
s
breast
,
this
pleasant
,
genial
smoke
we
had
,
soon
thaw
it
out
,
and
left
us
croni
.
he
seem
to
take
to
me
quit
as
natur
and
unbidden
as
i
to
him
;
and
when
our
smoke
was
over
,
he
press
his
forehead
against
mine
,
clasp
me
round
the
waist
,
and
said
that
henceforth
we
were
marri
;
mean
,
in
his
countri
'
s
phrase
,
that
we
were
bosom
friend
;
he
would
glad
die
for
me
,
if
need
should
be
.
in
a
countryman
,
this
sudden
flame
of
friendship
would
have
seem
far
too
prematur
,
a
thing
to
be
much
distrust
;
but
in
this
simpl
savag
those
old
rule
would
not
appli
.
after
supper
,
and
anoth
social
chat
and
smoke
,
we
went
to
our
room
togeth
.
he
made
me
a
present
of
his
embalm
head
;
took
out
his
enorm
tobacco
wallet
,
and
grope
under
the
tobacco
,
drew
out
some
thirti
dollar
in
silver
;
then
spread
them
on
the
tabl
,
and
mechan
divid
them
into
two
equal
portion
,
push
one
of
them
toward
me
,
and
said
it
was
mine
.
i
was
go
to
remonstr
;
but
he
silenc
me
by
pour
them
into
my
trowser
'
pocket
.
i
let
them
stay
.
he
then
went
about
his
even
prayer
,
took
out
his
idol
,
and
remov
the
paper
fireboard
.
by
certain
sign
and
symptom
,
i
thought
he
seem
anxious
for
me
to
join
him
;
but
well
know
what
was
to
follow
,
i
deliber
a
moment
whether
,
in
case
he
invit
me
,
i
would
compli
or
otherwis
.
i
was
a
good
christian
;
born
and
bred
in
the
bosom
of
the
infal
presbyterian
church
.
how
then
could
i
unit
with
this
wild
idol
in
worship
his
piec
of
wood
?
but
what
is
worship
?
thought
i
.
do
you
suppos
now
,
ishmael
,
that
the
magnanim
god
of
heaven
and
earth
--
pagan
and
all
includ
--
can
possibl
be
jealous
of
an
insignific
bit
of
black
wood
?
imposs
!
but
what
is
worship
?--
to
do
the
will
of
god
--
that
is
worship
.
and
what
is
the
will
of
god
?--
to
do
to
my
fellow
man
what
i
would
have
my
fellow
man
to
do
to
me
--
that
is
the
will
of
god
.
now
,
queequeg
is
my
fellow
man
.
and
what
do
i
wish
that
this
queequeg
would
do
to
me
?
whi
,
unit
with
me
in
my
particular
presbyterian
form
of
worship
.
consequ
,
i
must
then
unit
with
him
in
his
;
ergo
,
i
must
turn
idol
.
so
i
kindl
the
shave
;
help
prop
up
the
innoc

idol
;
offer
him
burnt
biscuit
with
queequeg
;
salam
befor
him
twice
or
thrice
;
kiss
his
nose
;
and
that
done
,
we
undress
and
went
to
bed
,
at
peac
with
our
own
conscienc
and
all
the
world
.
but
we
did
not
go
to
sleep
without
some
littl
chat
.
how
it
is
i
know
not
;
but
there
is
no
place
like
a

for
confidenti

between

they
say
,
there
open

at

by

what
littl
nappish
remain
in

altogeth

,
and
we
felt

get
up
again
,
though
day

break
was
yet
some
way
down
the
futur
.
yes
,
we
becam
veri
wake
;
so
much
so
that
our
recumb
posit
began
to
grow
wearisom
,
and
by
littl
and
littl
we
found
ourselv
sit
up
;
the
cloth
well
tuck
around
us
,
lean
against
the
head
-
board
with
our
four
knee
drawn
up
close
togeth
,
and
our
two
nose
bend
over
them
,
as
if
our
kneepan
were
warm

pan
.
we
felt
veri
nice
and
snug
,
the
more
so
sinc
it
was
so
chilli
out
of
door
;
inde
out
of
bed
-
cloth
too
,
see
that
there
was
no
fire
in
the
room
.
the
more
so
,
i
say
,
becaus
truli
to
enjoy
bodili
warmth
,
some
small
part
of
you
must
be
cold
,
for
there
is
no
qualiti
in
this
world
that
is
not
what
it
is
mere
by
contrast
.
noth
exist
in
itself
.
if
you
flatter
yourself
that
you
are
all
over
comfort
,
and
have
been
so
a
long
time
,
then
you
cannot
be
said
to
be
comfort
ani
more
.
but
if
,
like
queequeg
and
me
in
the
bed
,
the
tip
of
your
nose
or
the
crown
of
your
head
be
slight
chill
,
whi
then
,
inde
,
in
the
general
conscious
you
feel
most
delight
and
unmistak
warm
.
for
this
reason
a
sleep
apart
should
never
be
furnish
with
a
fire
,
which
is
one
of
the
luxuri
discomfort
of
the
rich
.
for
the
height
of
this
sort
of
delici
is
to
have
noth
but
the
blanket
between
you
and
your
snug
and
the
cold
of
the
outer
air
.
then
there
you
lie
like
the
one
warm
spark
in
the
heart
of
an
arctic
crystal
.
we
had
been
sit
in
this
crouch
manner
for
some
time
,
when
all
at
onc
i
thought
i
would
open
my
eye
;
for
when
between
sheet
,
whether
by
day
or
by
night
,
and
whether
asleep
or
awak
,
i
have
a
way
of
alway
keep
my
eye
shut
,
in
order
the
more
to
concentr
the
snug
of
be
in

becaus
no
man
can
ever
feel
his
own
ident
aright
except
his

be
close
;
as
if
dark
were
inde
the

be
more
congeni

clayey
part

upon

my

then
,
and
come
out
of

nor
did
i
at
all
object
to
the
hint
from
queequeg
that
perhap
it
were
best
to
strike
a
light
,
see
that
we
were
so
wide
awak
;
and
besid
he
felt
a
strong
desir
to
have
a
few
quiet
puff
from
his
tomahawk
.
be
it
said
,
that
though
i
had
felt
such
a
strong
repugn
to
his

in

the
night
befor
,
yet
see
how
elast
our
stiff
prejudic
grow
when

come
to

for
now
i
like
noth
better
than
to
have
queequeg
smoke
by
me
,
even
in

,
becaus
he
seem
to
be
full
of
such
seren

joy
then
.
i
no
more
felt

i
was
onli
aliv
to
the

a

with
a
real

.
with
our

drawn
about

we
now
pass
the
tomahawk
from
one
to

other
,
till

there
grew
over
us
a

hang

of

whether
it

roll
the

away
to

distant

i

not
,
but
he
now
spoke
of
his

and
,
eager
to
hear
his
histori

i
beg
him
to
go
on

told

he
might

but
this
fine
young
savag
--
this
sea
princ
of
wale
,
never

they
put
him
down

but
,
ala

the
practic
of

soon
convinc
him
that

about

i
ask
him
whether

it

at

the

will
sometim
be

as

but
these
extravaganza
onli
show
that
nantucket
is
no
illinoi
.
look
now
at
the
wondrous
tradit
stori
of
how
this
island
was
settl
by
the
red

.
thus
goe
the
legend
.
in
olden
time
an
eagl
swoop
down
upon

coast
,
and
carri
off
an

indian
in

with
loud
lament
the
parent
saw
their
child
born
out
of
sight
over
the
wide

.
they
resolv
to
follow
in
the

direct
.
set
out
in
their
cano
,
after
a
peril
passag
they
discov
the
island
,
and
there
they
found
an
empti
ivori
casket
,--
the
poor
littl
indian
'
s
skeleton
.
what
wonder
,
then
,
that
these
nantucket
,
born
on
a
beach
,
should
take
to
the
sea
for
a
livelihood
!
they
first
caught
crab
and
quohog
in
the
sand
;
grown
bolder
,
they
wade
out
with
net
for
mackerel
;
more
experienc
,
they
push
off
in
boat
and
captur
cod
;
and
at
last
,
launch
a
navi
of
great
ship
on
the
sea
,
explor
this
wateri

;
put
an
incess
belt
of

peep

in

that
his

more
to

concoct
our

for

but
to
my

no

me
to

that

and
yojo
had
told
him
two

time
over
,
and
strong
insist
upon
it
everyway
,
that
instead
of
our
go
togeth
among
the
whale

fleet
in

,
and
in
concert
select
our
craft
;
instead
of
this

i

enjoin
that
the
select
of

should
rest
wholli
with
me
,
inasmuch
as
yojo
purpos
befriend
us
;
and
,
in

to
do
so
,
had
alreadi
pitch
upon
a
vessel
,
which
,
if
left
to
myself
,
i

ishmael
,
should
infal
light
upon
,
for
all
the
world
as
though
it
had
turn
out
by

;

in
that
vessel
i
must
immedi
ship
myself

for
the

irrespect

as

perhap
meant
well
enough
upon

in

touch
the

i
did
not

at

i
had
not

i
was

for
it
seem
that
it

day
of

and
prayer
with
queequeg

after

you

for

moment
i
stood
a
littl
puzzl
by
this
curious
request
,
not
know
exact
how
to
take
it
,
whether

in

but
concentr
all

into

captain

start
me
on
the
errand

go
forward
and
glanc
over
the
weather
bow
,
i
perceiv
that
the
ship
swing
to
her
anchor
with
the
flood

tide
,
was
now
obliqu
point
toward
the
open
ocean

the
prospect
was
unlimit

but
exceed
monoton

forbid
;
not
the

i
could
see

"

said
peleg
when
i
came
back
;
"
what
did
ye

"
not

i
repli

he
led

on
the

was
what
seem
to
me
a
most
uncommon

it
turn
out
to
be

who
along
with

that
when

for

especi

he
was

to
say
the
least
.
he
never
use
to
swear
,
though
,
at
his

they
said
;
but
somehow
he
got
an
inordin
quantiti
of
cruel
,
unmitig
hard
work
out
of
them
.
when
bildad
was
a
chief

to

made

such
,
then
,
was
the
person
that
i
saw
seat
on
the
transom
when
i
follow
captain
peleg
down
into
the

.
the
space
between
the

was
small
;
and
there
,
bolt

sat
old

who
alway
sat
so

never

and
this
to

his

him

his

were

his

as
if
long
habitu
to

from

without

his

"

"

,
in
a
hollow
tone
,
and
turn
round
to
me
.
"
i

said
i
unconsci
,
he
was
so
intens
a

"
what

"

eye
me
,
and
then
went
on
spell
away
at
his
book
in
a
mumbl
tone
quit
audibl
.
i
thought
him
the
queerest
old
quaker
i
ever
saw
,
especi
as
peleg
,
his
friend
and
old
shipmat
,
seem
such
a
bluster
.
but
i
said
noth
,
onli
look
round
me
sharpli
.
peleg
now
threw
open
a
chest
,
and
draw
forth
the
ship
'
s
articl
,
place
pen
and
ink
befor
him
,
and
seat
himself
at
a
littl
tabl
.
i
began
to
think
it
was
high
time
to
settl
with
myself
at
what
term
i
would
be
will
to
engag
for
the
voyag
.
i
was
alreadi
awar
that
in
the
whale
busi
they
paid
no
wage
;
but
all
hand
,
includ
the
captain
,
receiv
certain
share
of
the
profit
call
lay
,
and
that
these
lay
were
proport
to
the
degre
of
import
pertain
to
the
respect
duti
of
the
ship
'
s
compani
.
i
was
also
awar
that
be
a
green
hand
at
whale
,
my
own
lay
would
not
be
veri
larg
;
but
consid
that
i
was
use
to
the
sea
,
could
steer
a
ship
,
splice
a
rope
,
and
all
that
,
i
made
no
doubt
that
from
all
i
had
heard
i
should
be
offer
at
least
the
275th
lay
--
that
is
,
the
275th
part
of
the
clear
net
proceed
of
the
voyag
,
whatev
that
might
eventu
amount
to
.
and
though
the
275th
lay
was
what
they
call
a
rather
long
lay
,
yet
it
was
better
than
noth
;
and
if
we
had
a
lucki
voyag
,
might
pretti
near
pay
for
the
cloth
i
would
wear
out
on
it
,
not
to
speak
of
my
three
year
'
beef
and
board
,
for
which
i
would
not
have
to
pay
one
stiver
.
it
might
be
thought
that
this
was
a
poor
way
to
accumul
a
princ
fortun
--
and
so
it
was
,
a
veri
poor
way
inde
.
but
i
am
one
of
those
that
never
take
on
about
princ
fortun
,
and
am
quit
content
if
the
world
is
readi
to
board
and
lodg
me
,
while
i
am
put
up
at
this
grim
sign
of
the
thunder
cloud
.
upon
the
whole
,
i
thought
that
the
275th
lay
would
be
about
the
fair
thing
,
but
would
not
have
been
surpris
had
i
been
offer
the
200th
,
consid
i
was
of
a
broad
-
shoulder
make
.
but
one
thing
,
nevertheless
,
that
made
me
a
littl
distrust
about
receiv
a
generous
share
of
the
profit
was
this
:
ashor
,
i
had
heard
someth
of
both
captain
peleg
and
his
unaccount
old
croni
bildad
;
how
that
they
be
the
princip
proprietor
of
the
pequod
,
therefor
the
other
and
more
inconsider
and
scatter
owner
,
left
near
the
whole
manag
of
the
ship
'
s
affair
to
these
two
.
and
i
did
not
know
but
what
the
stingi
old
bildad
might
have
a
mighti
deal
to
say
about
ship
hand
,
especi
as
i
now
found
him
on
board
the
pequod
,
quit
at
home
there
in
the
cabin
,
and
read
his
bibl
as
if
at
his
own
firesid
.
now
while
peleg
was
vain
tri
to
mend
a
pen
with
his
jack
-
knife
,
old
bildad
,
to
my
no
small
surpris
,
consid
that
he
was
such
an
interest
parti
in
these
proceed
;
bildad
never
heed
us
,
but
went
on
mumbl
to
himself
out
of
his
book
,
"

"

was
the

"

well

you
are

that
i
,
for

,
shall
not
lay
up
mani

it
was
an
exceed
long
lay
that
,
inde
;
and
though
from
the
magnitud
of
the
figur
it
might
at
first
deceiv
a
landsman
,
yet
the
slightest
consider
will
show
that
though
seven
hundr
and
seventi
-
seven
is
a
pretti
larg
number
,
yet
,
when
you
come
to
make
a
teenth
of
it
,
you
will
then
see
,
i
say
,
that
the
seven
hundr
and
seventi
-
seventh
part
of
a
farth
is
a
good
deal
less
than
seven
hundr
and
seventi

seven
gold
doubloon
;
and
so
i
thought
at
the
time
.
"
whi
,
blast

cri
peleg
,
"
thou
dost
not

this

!
he
must
have
more
than
that
."
"
seven
hundr
and
seventi
-
seventh
,"
again
said
bildad
,
without
lift
his
eye
;
and
then
went
on
mumbl
--"
for
where
your
treasur
is
,
there
will
your
heart
be
also
."
"
i
am

to
put

down
for

said
peleg
,
"
do
ye
hear
that

bildad
!
the
three
hundredth
lay
,
i
say
."
bildad
laid
down
his
book
,
and
turn
solemn
toward
him
said
,
"

hast

him
such

i

with

he
look

all
we
said
,
not

could
we
drag
out
of
him
;
i
almost
felt

him
over

so
as

for
it

it

close
the

upon
the

,
i
endeavor
to
prevail
upon
queequeg
to
take
a
chair
;

in

there
he
sat
;
and
all
he
could
do
--
for
all
my
polit

--
he
would
not

if

can

do
they
fast
on

way

it
must
be
so
;
yes
,
it
'

part
of

i
suppos
;
well
,
then
,
let
him
rest
;
he
'

get
up
sooner

no

it
can

,
thank

his

onli
come
onc
a

;
and
i
don
'
t
believ
it
'
s
veri
punctual
then
.
i
went
down
to
supper
.
after
sit
a
long
time
listen
to
the
long
stori
of
some
sailor
who
had
just
come
from
a
plum
-
pud
voyag
,
as
they
call
it
(
that
is
,
a

of

after
listen
to
these
plum

pudding
till
near
eleven
o
'
clock
,
i
went
up
stair
to
go
to
bed
,
feel
quit
sure
by
this
time
queequeg
must
certain
have
brought
his
ramadan
to
a
termin
.
but
no
;
there
he
was
just
where
i
had
left
him
;
he
had
not
stir
an
inch
.
i
began
to
grow
vex
with
him
;
it
seem
so
downright
senseless
and
insan
to
be
sit
there
all
day
and
half
the
night
on
his
ham
in
a
cold
room
,
hold
a
piec
of
wood
on
his
head
.
"
for
heaven
'
s
sake
,
queequeg
,
get
up
and
shake
yourself
;
get
up
and
have
some
supper
.
you
'
ll
starv
;
you
'
ll
kill
yourself
,
queequeg
."
but
not
a
word
did
he
repli
.
despair
of
him
,
therefor
,
i
determin
to
go
to
bed
and
to
sleep
;
and
no
doubt
,
befor
a
great
while
,
he
would
follow
me
.
but
previous
to
turn
in
,
i
took
my
heavi
bearskin
jacket
,
and
threw
it
over
him
,
as
it
promis
to
be
a
veri
cold
night
;
and
he
had
noth
but
his
ordinari
round
jacket
on
.
for
some
time
,
do
all
i
would
,
i
could
not
get
into
the
faintest
doze
.
i
had
blown
out
the
candl
;
and
the
mere
thought
of
queequeg
--
not
four
feet
off
--
sit
there
in
that
uneasi
posit
,
stark
alon
in
the
cold
and
dark
;
this
made
me
realli
wretch
.
think
of
it
;
sleep
all
night
in
the
same
room
with
a
wide
awak
pagan
on
his
ham
in
this
dreari
,
unaccount
ramadan
!
but
somehow
i
drop
off
at
last
,
and
knew
noth
more
till
break
of
day
;
when
,
look
over
the
bedsid
,
there
squat
queequeg
,
as
if
he
had
been
screw
down
to
the
floor
.
but
as
soon
as
the
first
glimps
of
sun
enter
the
window
,
up
he
got
,
with
stiff
and
grate
joint
,
but
with
a
cheer
look
;
limp
toward
me
where
i
lay
;
press
his
forehead
again
against
mine
;
and
said
his
ramadan
was
over
.
now
,
as
i
befor
hint
,
i
have
no
object
to
ani
person
'
s
religion
,
be
it
what
it
may
,
so
long
as
that
person
doe
not
kill
or
insult
ani
other
person
,
becaus
that
other
person
don
'
t
believ
it
also
.
but
when
a
man
'
s
religion
becom
realli
frantic
;
when
it
is
a
posit
torment
to
him
;
and
,
in
fine
,
make
this
earth
of
our
an
uncomfort
inn
to
lodg
in
;
then
i
think
it
high
time
to
take
that
individu
asid
and
argu
the
point
with
him
.
and
just
so
i
now
did
with
queequeg
.
"
queequeg
,"
said
i
,
"
get
into
bed
now
,
and
lie
and
listen
to
me
."
i
then
went
on
,
begin
with
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
primit
religion
,
and
come
down
to
the
various
religion
of
the
present
time
,
dure
which
time
i
labor
to
show
queequeg
that
all
these
lent
,
ramadan
,
and
prolong
ham
-
squat
in
cold
,
cheerless
room
were
stark
nonsens
;
bad
for
the
health
;
useless
for
the
soul
;
oppos
,
in
short
,
to
the
obvious
law
of
hygien
and
common
sens
.
i
told
him
,
too
,
that
he
be
in
other
thing
such
an
extrem
sensibl
and
sagaci
savag
,
it
pain
me
,
veri
bad
pain
me
,
to
see
him
now
so
deplor
foolish
about
this
ridicul
ramadan
of
his
.
besid
,
argu
i
,
fast
make
the
bodi
cave
in
;
henc
the
spirit
cave
in
;
and
all
thought
born
of
a
fast
must
necessarili
be
half
-
starv
.
this
is
the
reason
whi
most
dyspept
religionist
cherish
such
melancholi
notion
about
their
hereaft
.
in
one
word
,
queequeg
,
said
i
,
rather
digress
;
hell
is
an
idea
first
born
on
an
undigest
appl
-
dumpl
;
and
sinc
then
perpetu
through
the
hereditari
dyspepsia
nurtur
by
ramadan
.
i
then
ask
queequeg
whether
he
himself
was
ever
troubl
with
dyspepsia
;
express
the
idea
veri
plain
,
so
that
he
could
take
it
in
.
he
said
no
;
onli
upon
one
memor
occas
.
it
was
after
a
great
feast
given
by
his
father
the
king
,
on
the
gain
of
a
great
battl
wherein
fifti
of
the
enemi
had
been
kill
by
about
two
o
'
clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
all
cook
and
eaten
that
veri
even
.
"
no
more
,
queequeg
,"
said
i
,
shudder
;
"
that
will
do
;"
for
i
knew
the
infer
without
his
further
hint
them
.
i
had
seen
a
sailor
who
had
visit
that
veri
island
,
and
he
told
me
that
it
was
the
custom
,
when
a
great
battl
had
been
gain
there
,
to
barbecu
all
the
slain
in
the
yard
or
garden
of
the
victor
;
and
then
,
one
by
one
,
they
were
place
in
great
wooden
trencher
,
and
garnish
round
like
a
pilau
,
with
breadfruit
and
cocoanut
;
and
with
some
parsley
in
their
mouth
,
were
sent
round
with
the
victor
'
s
compliment
to
all
his
friend
,
just
as
though
these
present
were
so
mani
christma
turkey
.
after
all
,
i
do
not
think
that
my
remark
about
religion
made
much
impress
upon
queequeg
.
becaus
,
in
the
first
place
,
he
somehow
seem
dull
of
hear
on
that
import
subject
,
unless
consid
from
his
own
point
of
view
;
and
,
in
the
second
place
,
he
did
not
more
than
one
third
understand
me
,
couch
my
idea
simpli
as
i
would
;
and
,
final
,
he
no
doubt
thought
he
knew
a
good
deal
more
about
the
true
religion
than
i
did
.
he
look
at
me
with
a
sort
of
condescend
concern
and
compass
,
as
though
he
thought
it
a
great
piti
that
such
a
sensibl
young
man
should
be
so
hopeless
lost
to
evangel
pagan
pieti
.
at
last
we
rose
and
dress
;
and
queequeg
,
take
a
prodigi
hearti
breakfast
of
chowder
of
all
sort
,
so
that
the
landladi
should
not
make
much
profit
by
reason
of
his
ramadan
,
we
salli
out
to
board
the
pequod
,
saunter
along
,
and
pick
our
teeth
with
halibut
bone
.

dure
these
day
of

queequeg
and
i
often
visit
the

as

i
ask
about

how
he
was

and
when
he
was
go
to
come

to

question
they
would
answer

that
he
was
get
better

was
expect

meantim
,
the

captain

peleg

bildad
,
could
attend
to
everyth
necessari
to
fit
the

if
i
had
been
downright
honest
with
myself
,
i
would
have
seen
veri
plain
in
my
heart
that
i
did
but
half
fanci
be
commit
this
way
to
so
long
a
voyag
,
without
onc
lay
my
eye
on
the
man
who
was
to
be
the
absolut
dictat
of
it
,
so
soon
as
the
ship
sail
out
upon

but
when
a

suspect

wrong
,
it
sometim
happen
that
if
he
be

,
he
insens
strive
to
cover
up

from

and
much
this

it
was
with

i

at

he
put

issu
from

,
and
turn
to
the

said
bildad
,
"
but
away
with

do

how
now
!
here
upon
the
veri
point
of
start
for
the
voyag
,
captain
peleg
and
captain
bildad
were
go
it
with
a
high
hand
on
the
quarter
-
deck
,
just
as
if
they
were
to
be
joint
-
command
at
sea
,
as
well
as
to
all
appear
in
port
.
and
,
as
for
captain
ahab
,
no
sign
of
him
was
yet
to
be
seen
;
onli
,
they
said
he
was
in
the
cabin
.
but
then
,
the
idea
was
,
that
his
presenc
was
by
no
mean
necessari
in
get
the
ship
under
weigh
,
and
steer
her
well
out
to
sea
.
inde
,
as
that
was
not
at
all
his
proper
busi
,
but
the
pilot
'
s
;
and
as
he
was
not
yet
complet
recov
--
so
they
said
--
therefor
,
captain
ahab
stay
below
.
and
all
this
seem
natur
enough
;
especi
as
in
the
merchant
servic
mani
captain
never
show
themselv
on
deck
for
a
consider
time
after
heav
up
the
anchor
,
but
remain
over
the
cabin
tabl
,
have
a
farewel
merri
-
make
with
their
shore
friend
,
befor
they
quit
the
ship
for
good
with
the
pilot
.
but
there
was
not
much
chanc
to
think
over
the
matter
,
for
captain
peleg
was
now
all
aliv
.
he
seem
to
do
most
of
the
talk
and
command
,
and
not
bildad
.
"
aft
here
,
ye
son
of
bachelor
,"
he
cri
,
as
the
sailor
linger
at
the
main

mast
.
"
mr

starbuck
,

em

"
strike
the
tent
there
!"--
was
the
next
order
.
as
i
hint
befor
,
this
whalebon
marque
was
never
pitch
except
in
port
;
and
on
board
the
pequod
,
for
thirti
year
,
the
order
to
strike
the
tent
was
well
known
to
be
the
next
thing
to
heav
up
the
anchor
.
"
man
the
capstan
!
blood
and
thunder
!--
jump
!"--
was
the
next
command
,
and
the
crew
sprang
for
the
handspik
.
now
in
get
under
weigh
,
the
station
general
occupi
by
the
pilot
is
the
forward
part
of
the
ship
.
and
here
bildad
,
who
,
with
peleg
,
be
it
known
,
in
addit
to
his
other
offic
,
was
one
of
the
licens
pilot
of
the
port
--
he
be
suspect
to
have
got
himself
made
a
pilot
in
order
to
save
the
nantucket
pilot
-
fee
to
all
the
ship
he
was
concern
in
,
for
he
never
pilot
ani
other
craft
--
bildad
,
i
say
,
might
now
be
seen
activ
engag
in
look
over
the
bow
for
the
approach
anchor
,
and
at
interv
sing
what
seem
a
dismal
stave
of
psalmodi
,
to
cheer
the
hand
at
the
windlass
,
who
roar
forth
some
sort
of
a
chorus
about
the
girl
in
boobl
alley
,
with
hearti
good
will
.
nevertheless
,
not
three
day
previous
,
bildad
had
told
them
that
no
profan
song
would
be
allow
on
board
the
pequod
,
particular
in
get
under
weigh
;
and
chariti
,
his
sister
,
had
place
a
small
choic
copi
of
watt
in
each
seaman
'
s
berth
.
meantim
,
overse
the
other
part
of
the
ship
,
captain
peleg
rip
and
swore
astern
in
the
most
fright
manner
.
i
almost
thought
he
would
sink
the
ship
befor
the
anchor
could
be
got
up
;
involuntarili
i
paus
on
my
handspik
,
and
told
queequeg
to
do
the
same
,
think
of
the
peril
we
both
ran
,
in
start
on
the
voyag
with
such
a
devil
for
a
pilot
.
i
was
comfort
myself
,
howev
,
with
the
thought
that
in
pious
bildad
might
be
found
some
salvat
,
spite
of
his
seven
hundr
and
seventi
-
seventh
lay
;
when
i
felt
a
sudden
sharp
poke
in
my
rear
,
and
turn
round
,
was
horrifi
at
the
apparit
of
captain
peleg
in
the
act
of
withdraw
his
leg
from
my
immedi
vicin
.
that
was
my
first
kick
.
"
is
that
the

he
roar
.
"

at
last
the

was
up
,
the

set
,
and
off
we
glide
.
it
was
a
short
,
cold
christma
;
and
as
the
short
northern
day
merg
into

,
we
found
ourselv
almost
broad
upon

in

as

the

all
over

were

never
did
those
sweet
word
sound
more
sweet
to
me
than
then
.
they
were
full
of
hope
and
fruition
.
spite
of
this
frigid
winter
night
in
the
boister
atlant
,
spite
of
my
wet
feet
and
wetter

,
there
was
yet
,
it
then
seem
to
me

mani
a
pleasant
haven
in

etern
vernal
,
that
the
grass
shot
up
by

,
untrodden
,
unwilt

remain
at
midsumm

at
last
we
gain
such
an
of
,
that
the
two
pilot
were
need
no
longer
.
the
stout
sail
-
boat
that
had
accompani
us
began
rang
alongsid
.
it
was
curious
and
not
unpleas
,
how
peleg
and
bildad
were
affect
at
this
junctur
,
especi
captain

for
loath
to

veri

for

a

bound
on
so
long
and

a

--
beyond

a

in
which
some
thousand
of
his
hard

,--
poor
old
bildad
linger
long
;
pace
the
deck
with
anxious
stride
;
ran
down
into
the
cabin
to
speak
anoth
farewel
word
there
;
again
came
on
deck
,
and
look
to
windward

look
toward
the
wide
and
endless
water
,
onli
bound
by

look
toward

at

coil

convuls
grasp
stout

up

much
as
to

"
nevertheless

yes

as
for
peleg
himself
,
he
took
it
more
like
a
philosoph

but
for
all
his
philosophi
,
there
was
a
tear
twinkl
in
his

when
the

came

reason
whi
the
world
declin
honour
us
whalemen
,
is
this
:
they
think
that
,
at
best
,
our
vocat
amount
to
a
butcher
sort
of
busi
;
and
that
when
activ

we

all

butcher
we
are
,
that
is
true
.
but
butcher
,
also
,
and
butcher
of
the
bloodiest
badg
have
been
all
martial
command
whom
the
world
invari
delight
to
honour
.
and
as
for
the
matter
of
the
alleg
uncleanli
of
our
busi
,
ye
shall
soon
be
initi
into
certain
fact
hitherto
pretti
general
unknown
,
and
which
,
upon
the
whole
,
will
triumphant
plant
the
sperm
whale

ship
at
least
among
the
cleanliest
thing
of
this
tidi
earth
.
but
even
grant
the
charg
in
question
to
be
true
;
what
disord
slipperi
deck
of
a

are
compar
to
the

of

and
if
the
idea
of

so
much
enhanc
the
popular
conceit
of
the

'
s
profess
;
let
me
assur
ye
that
mani
a
veteran
who
has
freeli
march
up
to
a

,
would
quick
recoil
at
the
apparit
of
the
sperm

'
s

,
fan
into
eddi
the

over
his

.
for
what
are
the
comprehens
terror
of
man
compar
with
the
interlink
terror
and
wonder
of
god
!
but
,
though
the
world
scout
at
us
whale

,
yet
doe
it
unwit
pay
us
the
profoundest
homag
;
yea

for
almost
all
the

and

that

,

,
as
befor
so

,
to
our

but
look
at
this
matter
in
other
light
;
weigh
it
in
all
sort
of
scale
;
see
what
we
whalemen
are
,
and
have
been
.
whi
did
the
dutch
in
de
witt
'

time
have
admir
of
their
whale

?
whi
did
loui
xvi

at

expens
,
fit
out

from
dunkirk
,
and
polit
invit
to
that
town
some
score
or
two
of
famili
from
our
own
island
of
nantucket
?
whi
did
britain
between
the
year
1750
and
1788
pay
to
her
whalemen
in
bounti
upward
of

,
000
,

?
and
last
,
how
come
it
that
we
whalemen
of
america
now
outnumb
all
the
rest
of
the
band
whalemen
in
the
world
;
sail
a
navi

and
everi

import

how
come
all
this
,
if
there
be
not

but
this
is
not
the
half
;
look

said

,
"
who
is
not
afraid
of
a

by
this
,
he
seem
to
mean
,
not
onli
that
the
most
reliabl
and
use
courag
was
that
which
aris
from
the
fair
estim
of

that
an

is
a

more

than

"

said

the

"
starbuck
,
there

is
as

as
you

find

but
we
shall
ere
long
see
what
that
word
"
care
"
precis
mean
when
use
by
a
man
like
stubb
,
or
almost
ani
other
whale
hunter
.
starbuck
was
no
crusad
after
peril
;
in
him
courag
was
not
a
sentiment
;
but
a
thing
simpli
use
to
him
,
and
alway
at
hand
upon
all
mortal
practic
occas
.
besid
,
he
thought
,
perhap
,
that
in
this
busi
of
whale
,
courag
was
one
of
the
great
stapl
outfit
of
the
ship
,
like
her
beef
and
her
bread
,
and
not
to
be
foolish
wast
.
wherefor
he
had
no
fanci
for
lower
for
whale
after
sun
-
down
;
nor
for
persist
in
fight
a
fish
that
too
much
persist
in
fight
him
.
for
,
thought
starbuck
,
i
am
here
in
this
critic
ocean
to
kill
whale
for
my
live
,
and
not
to
be
kill
by
them
for
their
;
and
that
hundr
of
men
had
been
so
kill
starbuck
well
knew
.
what
doom
was
his
own
father
'
s
?
where
,
in
the
bottomless
deep
,
could
he
find
the
torn
limb
of
his
brother
?
with
memori
like
these
in
him
,
and
,
moreov
,
given
to
a
certain
superstiti
,
as
has
been
said
;
the
courag
of
this
starbuck
which
could
,
nevertheless
,
still
flourish
,
must
inde
have
been
extrem
.
but
it
was
not
in
reason
natur
that
a
man
so
organ
,
and
with
such
terribl
experi
and
remembr
as
he
had
;
it
was
not
in
natur
that
these
thing
should
fail
in
latent
engend
an
element
in
him
,
which
,
under
suitabl
circumst
,
would
break
out
from
it
confin
,
and
burn
all
his
courag
up
.
and
brave
as
he
might
be
,
it
was
that
sort
of
braveri
chiefli
,
visibl
in
some
intrepid

,
which
,
while

as
if
the
most
dead
encount
were
but
a
dinner
,
and
his

he
was
as
particular
about
the

of
his
part
of
the

,
as
an
old

is
about

when

he
handl

long

,
for

convert
the
jaw
of
death
into
an

what
he
thought
of
death
itself
,
there
is
no
tell
.
whether
he
ever
thought
of
it
at
all
,
might
be
a
question
;
but
,
if
he
ever
did
chanc
to
cast
his
mind
that
way
after
a
comfort
dinner
,
no
doubt
,
like
a
good

,
he
took
it
to
be
a
sort
of
call
of
the
watch
to
tumbl
aloft
,
and
bestir
themselv
there
,
about
someth
which
he
would
find
out
when

obey

not

what
,
perhap

with

made

such
an

so

of

in

full
of

pedlar
,
all
bow
to

with
their
pack
;
what
help
to
bring
about
that
almost
impious
good
-
humor
of
his
;
that
thing
must
have
been
his
pipe
.
for
,
like
his
nose
,
his
short
,
black
littl
pipe
was
one
of
the
regular
featur
of
his

.
you
would
almost
as
soon
have
expect
him
to
turn
out
of
his
bunk
without
his
nose
as
without
his
pipe
.
he
kept
a
whole
row
of
pipe
there
readi
load
,
stuck
in
a
rack
,
within
easi
reach
of
his

and
,
whenev

turn

he
smoke
them
all
out

light
one
from

then
load

instead

put

he
put

into

i
say
this
continu

must
have
been
one
caus
,
at

,
of

for
everi

know
that
this

is
terribl
infect
with
the
nameless
miseri
of
the
numberless
mortal

and
as
in

of

,
some
peopl
go
about

;
so
,
likewis

stubb

the

somehow
seem
to
think
that

;
and
therefor
it
was
a
sort
of
point
of

with

to
destroy

so
utter
lost
was
he
to

the

;
and
so
dead
to
anyth
like
an
apprehens
of
ani
possibl
danger
from

them
;
that
in
his
poor
opinion
,
the

stood
upon

there
seem
no

nor

he

right
down

,
till
it
disappear
in

,
you
saw
a
slender
rod
-

,
livid

it
resembl
that

sometim
made
in
the

,
when

leav

still

whether
that
mark
was
born
with

,
or
whether
it
was
the
scar
left
by
some

,
no

could

by

,
throughout

onc

an

superstiti
assert
that
not
till

did
ahab
becom
that

,
and
then
it
came
upon
him
,
not
in
the
furi
of
ani
mortal
fray
,
but
in
an
element
strife
at

.
yet
,
this
wild

seem
inferenti

by
what
a

insinu
,
an

,
who
,
have
never

sail
out

,
had
never
ere

laid

upon

.
nevertheless
,
the
old

-
tradit
,
the
immemori
credul
,
popular
invest
this
old
manxman
with
preternatur
power
of
discern
.
so
that
no
white
sailor
serious
contradict
him
when
he
said
that
if
ever
captain
ahab
should
be
tranquilli
laid
out
--
which
might
hard
come
to
pass
,
so
he
mutter
--
then
,
whoever
should
do

,
would
find

on

from

so
power
did
the
whole
grim
aspect
of
ahab
affect
me
,
and
the
livid
brand
which
streak
it
,
that
for
the
first
few

i
hard
note
that
not

of

was
owe
to
the

it

"

i
was
struck
with
the

he
maintain
.
upon
each
side
of
the

and
pretti
close

captain

stood
erect

straight
out

there
was
an
infin

fortitud

a
determin

wil
,
in
the
fix
and
fearless
,
forward
dedic
of
that
glanc
.
not
a
word
he
spoke
;
nor
did
his
offic
say
aught
to
him
;
though
by
all
their
minutest
gestur
and
express
,
they
plain
show
the
uneasi
,
if
not
pain
,
conscious
of
be
under
a
troubl

eye
.
and
not
onli
that
,
but
moodi
stricken
ahab
stood
befor
them
with
a
crucifixion
in
his
face
;
in
all
the
nameless
regal
overbear
digniti
of
some
mighti
woe
.
ere
long
,
from
his
first
visit
in
the
air
,
he
withdrew
into
his
cabin
.
but
after
that
morn
,
he
was
everi
day
visibl
to
the
crew
;
either
stand
in
his
pivot
-
hole
,
or
seat
upon
an
ivori
stool
he
had
;
or
heavili
walk
the
deck
.
as
the
sky
grew
less
gloomi
;
inde
,
began
to
grow
a
littl
genial
,
he
becam
still
less
and
less
a
reclus
;
as
if
,
when
the
ship
had
sail
from
home
,
noth
but
the
dead
wintri
bleak
of
the
sea
had
then
kept
him
so
seclud
.
and
,
by
and
by
,
it
came
to
pass
,
that
he
was
almost
continu
in
the
air
;
but
,
as
yet
,
for
all
that
he
said
,
or
percept
did
,
on
the
at
last
sunni

,
he
seem
as
unnecessari
there
as

but
the
pequod
was

so
that
there
was
littl

noth

out
of
himself
,
to
employ
or
excit
ahab
,
now
;
and
thus
chase
away
,
for
that
one
interv
,
the
cloud
that
layer

layer
were
pile
upon
his
brow
,
as
ever

nevertheless
,
ere
long
,
the
warm

of
the
pleasant

we
came

seem

in

a

more

behold

but
i
have
swam

i
have
had
to
do
with

with
these
visibl
hand
;
i
am
in

;
and
i
will
tri
.
there
are
some
preliminari
to
settl
.
first
:
the
uncertain
,
unsettl
condit
of
this
scienc
of
cetolog
is
in
the
veri
vestibul
attest
by
the
fact
,
that
in
some
quarter
it
still
remain
a
moot
point
whether
a
whale
be
a
fish
.
in
his
system
of
natur
,
a
.
d
.
1776
,
linnaeus
declar
,
"
i
herebi
separ
the
whale
from
the
fish
."
but
of
my
own
knowledg
,
i
know
that
down
to
the
year
1850
,
shark
and
shad
,
alew
and
herring
,
against
linnaeus
'
s
express
edict
,
were
still
found
divid
the
possess
of
the
same
sea
with
the
leviathan
.
the
ground
upon
which
linnaeus
would
fain
have
banish
the
whale
from
the
water
,
he
state
as
follow
:
"
on
account
of
their
warm
bilocular
heart
,
their
lung
,
their
movabl
eyelid
,
their
hollow
ear
,
penem
intrantem
feminam
mammi
lactantem
,"
and
final
,
"
ex
lege
natura
jure
meritoqu
."
i
submit
all
this
to
my
friend
simeon
macey
and
charley
coffin
,
of
nantucket
,
both
messmat
of
mine
in
a
certain
voyag
,
and
they
unit
in
the
opinion
that
the
reason
set
forth
were
altogeth
insuffici
.
charley
profan
hint
they
were
humbug
.
be
it
known
that
,
waiv
all
argument
,
i
take
the
good
old
fashion
ground
that
the
whale
is
a
fish
,
and
call
upon
holi
jonah
to
back
me
.
this
fundament
thing
settl
,
the
next
point
is
,
in
what
intern
respect
doe
the
whale
differ
from
other
fish
.
abov
,
linnaeus
has
given
you
those
item
.
but
in
brief
,
they
are
these
:
lung
and
warm
blood
;
wherea
,
all
other
fish
are
lungless
and
cold
blood
.
next
:
how
shall
we
defin
the
whale
,
by
his
obvious
extern
,
so
as
conspicu
to
label
him
for
all
time
to
come
?
to
be
short
,
then
,
a
whale
is
a
spout
fish
with
a
horizont
tail
.
there
you
have
him
.
howev
contract
,
that
definit
is
the
result
of
expand
medit
.
a
walrus
spout
much
like
a
whale
,
but
the
walrus
is
not
a
fish
,
becaus
he
is
amphibi
.
but
the
last
term
of
the
definit
is
still
more
cogent
,
as
coupl
with
the
first
.
almost
ani
one
must
have
notic
that
all
the
fish
familiar
to
landsmen
have
not
a
flat
,
but
a
vertic
,
or
up
-
and
-
down
tail
.
wherea
,
among
spout
fish
the
tail
,
though
it
may
be
similar
shape
,
invari
assum
a
horizont
posit
.
by
the
abov
definit
of
what
a
whale
is
,
i
do
by
no
mean
exclud
from
the
leviathan
brotherhood
ani
sea
creatur
hitherto
identifi
with
the
whale
by
the
best

nor

all

now
,
as
the
busi
of

,
ashor
or

,
is
a
veri
ancient
and
interest
one
,
let
us
in
some
measur
expati
here
.
i
take
it
,
that
the
earliest
stander
of
mast
-
head
were
the
old
egyptian
;
becaus
,
in
all
my
research
,
i
find
none
prior
to
them
.
for
though
their
progenitor
,
the
builder
of
babel
,
must
doubtless
,
by
their
tower
,
have
intend
to
rear
the
loftiest
mast
-
head
in
all
asia
,
or
africa
either
;
yet
(
ere
the
final
truck
was
put
to
it
)
as
that
great
stone
mast
of
their
may
be
said
to
have
gone
by
the
board
,
in
the
dread
gale
of
god
'
s
wrath
;
therefor
,
we
cannot
give
these
babel
builder
prioriti
over
the
egyptian
.
and
that
the
egyptian
were
a
nation
of
mast
-
head
stander
,
is
an
assert
base
upon
the
general
belief
among
archaeologist
,
that
the
first

found
for

purpos
:
a

those

were

to
mount

it
is
not

,
is
plain
evinc

an
item
for
which
obe

the
sole
historian

stand
account
.
the
worthi

us
,
that
in

of

,
ere

of

,
the
peopl

along

,
to
which
the
look

out
ascend
by
mean
of
nail
cleat
,
someth
as

upstair
in

.
a
few
year
ago
this

plan
was
adopt
by
the
bay
whalemen
of
new

,
who
,
upon
descri
the

,
gave
notic
to
the
readi

nigh

but
this
custom
has
now
becom
obsolet
;
turn
we
then
to
the
one
proper
mast

head
,
that
of
a
whale

ship
at

.
the
three
mast

head
are
kept
man
from

rise
to

;
the
seamen
take
their
regular
turn
(
as
at

helm
),
and
reliev
each
other
everi
two

in

of

tropic
it
is
exceed
pleasant
the
mast

head
;
nay
,
to
a
dreami

it
is
delight
.
there
you
stand
,
a
hundr
feet
abov
the
silent
deck
,
stride
along
the
deep
,
as
if
the
mast
were
gigant
stilt
,
while
beneath
you
and
between
your
leg
,
as
it
were
,
swim
the
hugest
monster
of
the

,
even
as

there
you
stand
,
lost

the
infinit

,
with
noth
ruffl

the

the
tranc

;
the

everyth

into

the
sum

it

to
be

,
in
cold

you
may
carri
your

with
you
,
in
the
shape
of
a

but
proper
speak
the
thickest

is
no
more
of

the

without

great
risk
of

(
like

so
a

not

you

concern

it
is
much
to

we

also

that

with

some

after

i
learn
that

was

for

that
by
no

had
aught
to

neither
had

knew
the
bird
to
be
an
albatross

yet
,
in
say
this
,
i
do
but
indirect
burnish
a
littl
brighter
the
nobl
merit
of
the
poem
and
the
poet
.
i
assert
,
then
,
that
in
the
wondrous
bodili
white
of
the
bird
chiefli
lurk
the
secret
of
the
spell
;
a
truth
the
more
evinc
in
this
,
that
by
a
solec
of
term
there
are
bird
call
grey
albatross
;
and
these
i
have
frequent
seen
,
but
never
with
such
emot
as
when
i
beheld
the
antarct
fowl
.
but
how
had
the
mystic
thing
been
caught
?
whisper
it
not
,
and
i
will
tell
;
with
a
treacher
hook
and
line
,
as
the
fowl
float
on
the
sea
.
at
last
the
captain
made
a

of
it
;
tie
a

leathern
talli
round
it

,
with
the

then

i
doubt
not
,
that
leathern
talli

meant

was
taken
off

it
is
that

the

first
:
the

when

if
by

he
hear
the

then
he
feel
a
silent

superstiti

;
the

he
never

yet
where
is
the

,
"

it

second
:

the

naught
of

except

perhap
,
in
the

of
the

at

vast
altitud

and
the
natur
conceit
of
what
a
fear
it
would
be
to
lose

in

much
the

is
it
with

in

whi
will
he
start

snort
,
and
with

paw
the

in

of

?
there
is
no
remembr
in
him
of

gore
of

in

,
so
that
the

cannot

for
what

,
this

colt

of

of

?
no
;
but
here
thou
beholdest
even
in

,
the
instinct
of

though
thousand

still
when

this

thus
,
then
,
the
muffl

of

;
the
bleak

of

the

all
these

are

though
neither

the

give

yet
with
me

is
it
that

perhap

though

yet
in

you
cannot
conclud
that
the

,
say
,
will
turn
out

as

natur

of

main
point
of
this
affair
.
i
care
not
to
perform
this
part
of
my
task
method
;
but
shall
be
content
to
produc
the
desir
impress
by
separ
citat
of
item
,
practic
or
reliabl
known
to
me
as
a
whaleman
;
and
from
these
citat
,
i
take
it
--
the
conclus
aim
at
will
natur
follow
of
itself
.
first
:
i
have
person
known
three
instanc
where
a
whale
,
after
receiv
a
harpoon
,
has
effect
a
complet
escap
;
and
,
after
an
interv
(
in
one
instanc
of
three
year
),
has
been
again
struck
by
the
same
hand
,
and
slain
;
when
the
two
iron
,
both
mark
by
the
same
privat
cypher
,
have
been
taken
from
the
bodi
.
in
the
instanc
where
three
year
interven
between
the
fling
of
the
two
harpoon
;
and
i
think
it
may
have
been
someth
more
than
that
;
the
man
who
dart
them
happen
,
in
the
interv
,
to
go
in
a
trade
ship
on
a
voyag
to
africa
,
went
ashor
there
,
join
a
discoveri
parti
,
and
penetr
far
into
the
interior
,
where
he
travel
for
a
period
of
near
two
year
,
often
endang
by
serpent
,
savag
,
tiger
,
poison
miasma
,
with
all
the
other
common
peril
incid
to
wander
in
the
heart
of
unknown
region
.
meanwhil
,
the
whale
he
had
struck
must
also
have
been
on
it
travel
;
no
doubt
it
had
thrice
circumnavig
the
globe
,
brush
with
it
flank
all
the
coast
of
africa
;
but
to
no
purpos
.
this
man
and
this
whale
again
came
togeth
,
and
the
one
vanquish
the
other
.
i
say
i
,
myself
,
have
known
three
instanc
similar
to
this
;
that
is
in
two
of
them
i
saw
the
whale
struck
;
and
,
upon
the
second
attack
,
saw
the
two
iron
with
the
respect
mark
cut
in
them
,
afterward
taken
from
the
dead
fish
.
in
the
three
-
year
instanc
,
it
so
fell
out
that
i
was
in
the
boat
both
time
,
first
and
last
,
and
the
last
time
distinct
recognis
a
peculiar
sort
of
huge
mole
under
the
whale
'
s
eye
,
which
i
had
observ
there
three
year
previous
.
i
say
three
year
,
but
i
am
pretti
sure
it
was
more
than
that
.
here
are
three
instanc
,
then
,
which
i
person
know
the
truth
of
;
but
i
have
heard
of
mani
other
instanc
from
person
whose
verac
in
the
matter
there
is
no
good
ground
to
impeach
.
second
:
it
is
well
known
in
the
sperm
whale
fisheri
,
howev
ignor
the
world
ashor
may
be
of
it
,
that
there
have
been
sever
memor
histor
instanc
where
a
particular
whale
in
the
ocean
has
been
at
distant
time
and
place
popular
cognis
.
whi
such
a
whale
becam
thus
mark
was
not
altogeth
and
origin
owe
to
his
bodili
peculiar
as
distinguish
from
other
whale
;
for
howev
peculiar
in
that
respect
ani
chanc
whale
may
be
,
they
soon
put
an
end
to
his
peculiar
by
kill
him
,
and
boil
him
down
into
a
peculiar
valuabl
oil
.
no
:
the
reason
was
this
:
that
from
the
fatal
experi
of
the
fisheri
there
hung
a
terribl
prestig
of
peril
about
such
a
whale
as
there
did
about
rinaldo
rinaldini
,
insomuch
that
most
fishermen
were
content
to
recognis
him
by
mere
touch
their
tarpaulin
when
he
would
be
discov
loung
by
them
on
the
sea
,
without
seek
to
cultiv
a
more
intim
acquaint
.
like
some
poor
devil
ashor
that
happen
to
know
an
irasc
great
man
,
they
make
distant
unobtrus
salut
to
him
in
the
street
,
lest
if
they
pursu
the
acquaint
further
,
they
might
receiv
a
summari
thump
for
their
presumpt
.
but
not
onli
did
each
of
these
famous

i
do
not
know
where
i
can
find
a
better
place
than
just
here
,
to
make
mention
of
one
or
two
other
thing
,
which
to
me
seem
import
,
as
in
print
form
establish
in
all
respect
the
reason
of
the
whole
stori
of
the
white
whale
,
more
especi
the
catastroph
.
for
this
is
one
of
those
dishearten
instanc
where
truth
requir
full
as
much
bolster
as
error
.
so
ignor
are
most
landsmen
of
some
of
the
plainest
and
most
palpabl
wonder
of
the
world
,
that
without
some
hint
touch
the
plain
fact
,
histor
and
otherwis
,
of
the
fisheri
,
they
might
scout
at
mobi
dick
as
a
monstrous
fabl
,
or
still
wors
and
more
detest
,
a
hideous
and
intoler
allegori
.
first
:
though
most
men
have
some
vagu
flit
idea
of
the
general
peril
of
the
grand
fisheri
,
yet
they
have
noth
like
a
fix
,
vivid
concept
of
those
peril
,
and
the
frequenc
with
which
they
recur
.
one
reason
perhap
is
,
that
not
one
in
fifti
of
the
actual
disast
and
death
by
casualti
in
the
fisheri
,
ever
find
a
public

at

,
howev
transient
and
immedi
forgotten
that
record
.
do
you
suppos
that
that
poor

there

who
this

off

is
be
carri
down

--
do
you

'
s
name
will
appear
in
the

obituari
you
will
read
to

at

?
no
:
becaus
the

are
veri
irregular
between
here
and

.
in
fact
,
did
you
ever
hear
what
might
be
call
regular
news
direct
or
indirect
from
new

?
yet
i
tell
you
that
upon
one
particular
voyag
which
i
made
to
the
pacif
,
among
mani
other
we
spoke
thirti
differ
ship
,
everi
one
of
which
had
had
a
death
by
a
whale
,
some
of
them
more
than
one
,
and
three
that
had
each
lost

.
second
:
peopl
ashor
have
inde
some
indefinit
idea
that
a
whale
is
an
enorm
creatur
of
enorm
power
;
but
i
have
ever
found
that
when
narrat
to
them
some
specif
exampl
of
this
two
-
fold
enorm
,
they
have
signific
compliment
me
upon
my
faceti
;
when
,
i
declar
upon
my
soul
,
i
had
no
more
idea
of
be
faceti
than
mose
,
when
he
wrote
the
histori
of
the
plagu
of
egypt
.
but
fortun
the
special
point
i
here
seek
can
be
establish
upon
testimoni
entir
independ
of
my
own
.
that
point
is
this
:
the
sperm
whale
is
in
some
case
suffici
power
,
know
,
and
judici
malici
,
as
with
direct
aforethought
to
stave
in
,
utter
destroy
,
and
sink
a
larg
ship
;
and
what
is
more
,
the
sperm
whale
has
done
it
.
first
:
in
the
year
1820
the
ship
essex
,
captain
pollard
,
of
nantucket
,
was
cruis
in
the
pacif
ocean
.
one
day
she
saw
spout
,
lower
her
boat
,
and
gave
chase
to
a
shoal
of
sperm
whale
.
ere
long
,
sever
of
the
whale
were
wound
;
when
,
sudden
,
a
veri
larg
whale
escap
from
the
boat
,
issu
from
the
shoal
,
and
bore
direct
down
upon
the
ship
.
dash
his
forehead
against
her
hull
,
he
so
stove
her
in
,
that
in
less
than
"
ten
minut
"
she
settl
down
and
fell
over
.
not
a
surviv
plank
of
her
has
been
seen
sinc
.
after
the
severest
exposur
,
part
of
the
crew

the
land
in
their
boat
.
be
return
home
at
last
,
captain
pollard
onc
more
sail
for
the
pacif
in
command
of
anoth
ship
,
but
the
god
shipwreck
him
again
upon
unknown
rock
and
breaker
;
for
the
second
time
his
ship
was
utter
lost
,
and
forthwith
forswear
the
sea
,
he
has
never
tempt
it
sinc
.
at
this
day
captain
pollard
is
a
resid
of
nantucket
.
i
have
seen
owen
chace
,
who
was
chief
mate
of
the
essex
at
the
time
of
the
tragedi
;
i
have
read
his
plain
and
faith
narrat
;
i
have
convers
with
his
son
;
and
all
this
within
a
few
mile
of
the
scene
of
the
catastroph
.*
*
the
follow
are
extract
from
chace
'
s
narrat
:
"
everi
fact
seem
to
warrant
me
in
conclud
that
it
was
anyth
but
chanc
which
direct
his
oper
;
he
made
two
sever
attack
upon
the
ship
,
at
a
short
interv
between
them
,
both
of
which
,
accord
to
their
direct
,
were
calcul
to
do
us
the
most
injuri
,
by
be
made
ahead
,
and
therebi
combin
the
speed
of
the
two
object
for
the
shock
;
to
effect
which
,
the
exact
manoeuvr
which
he
made
were
necessari
.
his
aspect
was
most
horribl
,
and
such
as
indic
resent
and
furi
.
he
came
direct
from
the
shoal
which
we
had
just
befor
enter
,
and
in
which
we
had
struck
three
of
his
companion
,
as
if
fire
with
reveng
for
their
suffer
."
again
:
"
at
all
event
,
the
whole
circumst
taken
togeth
,
all
happen
befor
my
own
eye
,
and

at
the
time

my

,
on
the
part
of
the

(
mani
of
which
impress
i
cannot
now
recal
),
induc
me
to
be
satisfi
that
i
am
correct

here
are
his
reflect
some
time
after

the
ship
,
dure
a
black
night

open

,
when
almost

langsdorff
thus
begin
his
seventeenth
chapter
:
"
by
the
thirteenth
of
may
our
ship
was
readi
to
sail
,
and
the
next
day
we
were
out
in
the
open
sea
,
on
our
way
to
ochotsh

the
weather
was
veri
clear
and
fine
,
but
so
intoler
cold
that
we
were
oblig
to
keep
on
our
fur
cloth
.
for
some
day
we
had
veri
littl
wind
;
it
was
not
till
the
nineteenth
that
a

gale
from

sprang
up

an

that
not

that

so

as

he

of
uncommon

by
the

he

alway

in

,
not
at

now
,
in
this
histori
of
his

procopius
mention
that
,
dure
the
term
of
his
prefectur
at
constantinopl
,
a

was

the

of

,
after
have
destroy
vessel
at

in
those

for
a
period
of
more
than
fifti
year
.
a
fact
thus
set
down
in
substanti
histori
cannot
easili
be
gainsaid
.
nor
is
there
ani
reason
it
should
be

of
what
precis
speci
this

was
,
is
not
mention

but
as
he
destroy
ship
,
as
well
as
for
other
reason
,
he
must
have
been
a
whale
;
and
i
am
strong
inclin
to
think
a
sperm
whale
.
and
i
will
tell
you
whi
.
for
a
long
time
i
fanci
that
the
sperm
whale
had
been
alway
unknown
in
the
mediterranean
and
the
deep
water
connect
with
it
.
even
now
i
am
certain
that
those
sea
are
not
,
and
perhap
never
can
be
,
in
the
present
constitut
of
thing
,
a
place
for
his
habitu
gregari
resort
.
but
further
investig
have
recent
prove
to
me
,
that
in
modern
time
there
have
been
isol
instanc
of
the
presenc
of
the
sperm
whale
in
the
mediterranean
.
i
am
told
,
on
good
author
,
that
on
the
barbari
coast
,
a
commodor
davi
of
the
british
navi
found
the
skeleton
of
a
sperm
whale
.
now
,
as
a
vessel
of
war
readili
pass
through
the
dardanell
,
henc
a
sperm
whale
could
,
by
the
same
rout
,
pass
out
of
the
mediterranean
into
the
proponti
.
in
the
proponti
,
as
far
as
i
can
learn
,
none
of
that
peculiar
substanc
call
brit
is
to
be
found
,
the
aliment
of
the
right
whale
.
but
i
have
everi
reason
to
believ
that
the
food
of
the
sperm
whale
--
squid
or
cuttl
-
fish
--
lurk
at
the
bottom
of
that
sea
,
becaus
larg
creatur
,
but
by
no
mean
the
largest
of
that
sort
,
have
been
found
at
it
surfac
.
if
,
then
,
you
proper
put
these
statement
togeth

and
reason
upon

a
bit
,
you
will
clear
perceiv
that

to

that
for

have
been

here
then

from

at

it

it

often
argu
with

whether
that

but
with

the
question
assum
a
modifi
aspect
.
consid
that
with

man
is
but
a
hobbl
wight
in
all
time
of
danger
;
consid
that
the
pursuit
of

is
alway

and
extraordinari
difficulti
;
that
everi

,
inde

under
these
circumst
is
it
wise
for
ani
maim
man
to
enter
a

-
boat
in
the
hunt
?
as
a
general
thing
,
the
joint
-
owner

must
have
plain

ahab
well
knew
that

would
think
littl
of
his
enter
a
boat
in
certain
compar
harmless
vicissitud
of
the
chase
,
for
the
sake
of
be
near
the
scene
of
action
and
give
his
order
in

,
yet
for
captain
ahab
to
have
a
boat
actual
apport
to
him
as
a
regular
headsman
in
the
hunt
--
abov
all
for
captain
ahab
to
be
suppli
with
five
extra
men
,
as
that
same
boat
'

crew
,
he
well
knew
that
such
generous
conceit
never
enter
the
head
of
the
owner
of
the
pequod
.
therefor
he
had
not
solicit
a
boat
'
s
crew
from
them
,
nor
had
he
in
ani
way
hint
his
desir
on
that
head
.
nevertheless
he
had
taken
privat
measur
of
his
own
touch
all
that
matter
.
until
cabaco
'
s
publish
discoveri
,
the
sailor
had
littl
foreseen
it
,
though
to
be
sure
when
,
after

a
littl
while
out

all

had
conclud
the
customari

when
some
time
after
this
ahab
was
now
and
then
found
bestir
himself
in
the
matter
of
make
thole
-
pin
with
his
own
hand
for
what
was
thought
to
be
one
of
the
spare
boat
,
and
even
solicit
cut
the
small
wooden
skewer
,
which
when
the
line
is
run
out
are
pin
over
the
groov
in

:
when
all
this
was
observ
in
him
,
and
particular
his
solicitud
in
have
an
extra
coat
of
sheath
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
,
as
if
to
make
it
better
withstand
the
point
pressur
of

;
and
also
the
anxieti

evinc

when
it
was
observ
how
often
he
stood
up
in
that

with
his
solitari
knee
fix
in
the
semi

circular

in

,
and
with

;
all
these
thing
,
i

,
had
awaken
much
interest
and
curios
at
the
time

but
almost
everybodi
suppos

the
ostens
reason
whi

did
not
go

was
this
:
the

even

he

not

if
so
it

by

he
had

put

to

from

such

when

,
the

regard
the

but
where

it

be

see
that

in

collect

kill
more

than
all

collect

in

this
is
a
harmless
littl
foibl
in

,
which
the
nantucket
doe
not
take
much
to

probabl
,
becaus
he

we

you

it
was
not
more
than
a

that

but
onli
so
as
to
requir
an
hour
or
more
at

everi

.
you
must
know
that
in
a
settl
and
civil
ocean
like
our
atlant
,
for
exampl
,
some
skipper
think
littl
of
pump
their
whole
way
across
it
;
though
of
a
still
,
sleepi
night
,
should
the
offic
of
the

happen
to
forget
his
duti
in
that
respect

the

would
be
that

would
never

on

nor
in

far
from

,
gentlemen
,
is
it
altogeth
unusu
for
ship
to
keep
clang
at
their
pump
-
handl
in
full
chorus
even
for
a
voyag
of

;
that
is
,
if
it
lie
along
a
toler
access
coast
,
or
if
ani
other
reason
retreat
is
afford
them
.
it
is
onli
when
a

vessel
is
in
some
veri
out
of

part
of
those

some
realli

that
her

begin
to
feel
a
littl
anxious
.
"
much
this
way
had
it
been
with
the
town
-
ho
;
so
when
her
leak
was
found
gain
onc
more
,
there
was
in
truth
some
small
concern
manifest
by
sever
of
her
compani
;
especi
by
radney
the
mate
.
he
command
the
upper
sail
to
be
well
hoist
,
sheet
home
anew
,
and
everi
way
expand
to
the
breez
.
now
this
radney
,
i
suppos
,
was
as
littl
of
a
coward
,
and
as
littl
inclin
to
ani
sort

touch
his

person
as
ani
fearless
,
unthink
creatur
on

or
on

that
you
can
conveni
imagin
,
gentlemen
.
therefor
when
he
betray
this
solicitud
about
the
safeti
of
the
ship
,
some
of
the
seamen
declar
that
it
was
onli
on
account
of
his
be
a
part
owner
in
her
.
so
when
they
were
work
that
even
at
the
pump
,
there
was
on
this
head
no
small
gamesom
slili
go
on
among
them
,
as
they
stood
with
their
feet
continu
overflow
by
the
rippl
clear
water
;
clear
as

,
gentlemen
--
that
bubbl
from
the
pump
ran
across
the
deck
,
and
pour
itself
out
in
steadi
spout
at
the
lee
scupper

hole
.
"
now
,
as
you
well
know
,
it
is
not
seldom
the
case
in
this
convent
world
of
our

wateri

;
that
when
a

find
one
of

his

straightway
against

he
conceiv
an
unconquer

bitter
;
and
if
he
have
a
chanc
he
will
pull
down

pulver
that

make

be
this
conceit

mine
as
it

gentlemen
,
at

steelkilt

now
,
by

odd
,
the
most
ancient

anyway

,
is
to
be
found
in
the
famous

almost

no

then
,
that
in

have
been

forth

the

refer

though
this
sculptur
is
half
man
and
half
whale
,
so
as
onli
to
give
the
tail
of
the
latter
,
yet
that
small
section
of
him
is
all
wrong

it
look
more
like
the
taper
tail
of
an
anaconda
,
than
the
broad
palm
of
the
true
whale

majest

but
go
to
the
old
galleri

and
look
now
at
a
great
christian
painter
'

portrait
of
this
fish
;
for

succeed
no

then
,
there

but
quit
all
these
unprofession
attempt
,
let
us
glanc
at
those
pictur
of
leviathan
purport
to
be
sober
,
scientif
delin
,
by
those
who
know
.
in
old
harri
'

collect
of
voyag
there
are
some
plate
of
whale
extract
from
a
dutch
book
of
voyag
,
a
.
d
.
1671
,
entitl
"

peterson

."
in
one
of
those
plate
the
whale
,
like
great
raft
of
log
,
are
repres
lie
among
ice
-
isl
,
with
white

run
over
their
live

.
in
anoth
plate
,
the
prodigi
blunder
is
made
of
repres
the
whale
with
perpendicular
fluke
.
then
again
,
there
is
an
impos
quarto
,
written
by
one
captain
colnett
,
a
post
captain
in
the
english
navi
,
entitl
"

in
this
book
is
an
outlin
purport

be

from
one
kill
on

coast
of

august
,
1793
,
and
hoist
on
deck
."
i
doubt
not
the
captain
had
this
veraci
pictur
taken
for
the
benefit
of
his
marin
.
to
mention
but
one
thing
about
it
,
let
me
say
that
it
has
an
eye
which
appli
,
accord
to
the
accompani
scale
,
to
a
full
grown
sperm
whale
,
would
make
the
eye
of
that
whale
a
bow
-
window
some
five
feet
long
.
ah
,
my
gallant
captain
,
whi
did
ye
not
give
us
jonah
look
out
of
that
eye
!
nor
are
the
most
conscienti
compil
of
natur
histori
for
the
benefit
of
the
young
and
tender
,
free
from
the
same
heinous
of
mistak
.
look
at
that
popular
work
"
goldsmith
'
s
anim
natur
."
in
the
abridg
london
edit
of
1807
,
there
are
plate
of
an
alleg
"
whale
"
and
a
"
narwhal
."
i
do
not
wish
to
seem
ineleg
,
but
this
unsight
whale
look
much
like
an
amput
sow
;
and
,
as
for
the
narwhal
,
one
glimps
at
it
is
enough
to
amaz
one
,
that
in
this
nineteenth
centuri
such
a
hippogriff
could
be
palm
for
genuin
upon
ani
intellig
public
of
schoolboy
.
then
,
again
,
in
1825
,
bernard
germain
,
count
de
laceped
,
a
great
naturalist
,
publish
a
scientif
system
whale
book
,
wherein
are
sever
pictur
of
the
differ
speci
of
the
leviathan
.
all
these
are
not
onli
incorrect
,
but
the
pictur
of
the
mysticetus
or
greenland
whale
(
that
is
to
say
,
the
right
whale
),
even
scoresbi
,
a
long
experienc
man
as
touch
that
speci
,
declar
not
to
have

but
the
place
of
the
cap
-
sheaf
to
all
this
blunder
busi
was
reserv
for
the
scientif
frederick
cuvier
,
brother
to
the
famous

.
in
1836
,
he
publish
a

in
which
he
give
what
he
call
a

befor
show
that
pictur
to

you
had

provid

in
a
word
,
frederick
cuvier
'
s
sperm
whale
is
not
a
sperm
whale
,
but
a
squash
.
of
cours
,
he
never
had
the

of

(
such
men
seldom
have
),
but
whenc
he
deriv
that
pictur

that

this

it

for

you

so
there
is
no

it

sometim

.
the
line
origin
use
in
the

was
of
the
best
hemp
,
slight
vapour
with
tar
,
not
impregn
with
it
,
as
in

case
of
ordinari
rope
;
for
while
tar
,
as
ordinarili
use
,
make
the
hemp
more
pliabl
to
the
rope
-
maker
,
and
also
render
the
rope
itself
more
conveni
to
the
sailor
for
common
ship
use
;
yet
,
not
onli
would
the
ordinari
quantiti
too
much
stiffen
the
whale
-
line
for
the
close
coil
to
which
it
must
be
subject
;
but
as
most
seamen
are
begin
to
learn
,
tar
in
general
by
no
mean
add
to
the
rope
'
s
durabl
or
strength
,
howev
much
it
may
give
it
compact
and
gloss
.
of
late
year
the
manilla
rope
has
in
the
american
fisheri
almost
entir
supersed
hemp
as
a
materi
for
whale

line
;
for
,
though
not
so
durabl
as
hemp
,
it
is
stronger
,
and
far
more
soft
and
elast
;
and
i
will
add
(
sinc
there
is
an
aesthet
in
all
thing
),
is
much
more
handsom
and
becom
to
the
boat
,
than
hemp
.
hemp
is
a
duski
,
dark
fellow
,
a
sort
of
indian

but
manilla
is
as
a

a

so
that

the

is

some

will
consum
almost
an

in

,
carri
the

high
aloft
and
then
reev
it
downward
through
a
block
toward
the

,
so
as
in
the
act
of
coil
to
free
it
from
all
possibl
wrinkl
and
twist
.
in
the
english

two

are
use
instead
of
one
;
the

be
continu
coil
in
both
tub

there
is
some
advantag
in
this
;
becaus
these
twin

tub
be
so
small
they
fit
more
readili
into
the
boat
,
and
do
not
strain
it
so
much
;
wherea
,
the
american

,
near
three

,
make
a

bulki
freight

for
the

which
will
bear

this

account

first
:
in

to
facilit
the
fasten

in

instanc

the

of

is
shift
like

as

from

at

to

it
consort
.
second
:
this
arrang
is
indispens
for
common
safeti
'
s
sake
;
for
were
the
lower
end
of
the
line
in
ani
way
attach
to
the
boat
,
and
were
the
whale
then
to

out
to

almost
in

smoke
minut
as

he

,
for
the
doom

be

into
the

;
and
in
that
case
no

would
ever
find

befor
lower
the

for
the
chase
,
the
upper
end
of
the

is
taken
aft
from

the

that
mortal
man
should
feed
upon
the
creatur
that
feed
his
lamp
,
and
,
like
stubb
,
eat
him
by
his
own
light
,
as
you
may
say
;
this
seem
so
outlandish
a
thing
that
one
must
need
go
a
littl
into
the
histori
and
philosophi
of
it
.
it
is
upon
record
,
that
three
centuri
ago
the
tongu
of
the
right
whale
was
esteem
a
great
delicaci
in
franc
,
and
command
larg
price
there
.
also
,
that
in
henri
viiith
'
s
time
,
a
certain
cook
of
the
court
obtain
a
handsom
reward
for
invent
an
admir
sauc
to
be
eaten
with
barbacu
porpois
,

you
rememb

porpois
,
inde
,
are
to
this
day
consid
fine
eat
.
the
meat
is
made
into
ball
about
the
size
of
billiard
ball
,
and
be
well
season
and
spice
might
be
taken
for
turtl
-
ball
or
veal
ball
.
the
old
monk
of
dunfermlin
were
veri
fond
of
them
.
they
had
a
great
porpois
grant
from
the
crown
.
the
fact
is
,
that
among
his
hunter
at
least
,
the
whale
would
by
all
hand
be
consid
a
nobl
dish
,
were
there
not
so
much
of
him
;
but
when
you
come
to
sit
down
befor
a
meat
-
pie
near
one
hundr
feet
long
,
it
take
away
your
appetit

onli
the
most
unprejud
of
men
like
stubb
,
nowaday
partak
of
cook
whale
;
but
the
esquimaux
are
not
so
fastidi
.
we
all
know
how
they
live
upon
whale
,
and
have
rare
old
vintag
of
prime
old

one
of
their
most
famous
doctor
,
recommend
strip
of
blubber
for
infant
,
as
be
exceed
juici
and
nourish
.
and
this
remind
me
that
certain
englishmen
,
who
long
ago
were
accident
left
in
greenland
by
a
whale
vessel
--
that
these
men
actual
live
for
sever
month
on
the
mouldi
scrap
of
whale
which
had
been
left
ashor
after
tri
out
the
blubber
.
among
the
dutch
whalemen
these
scrap
are
call
"

";
which
,
inde
,
they

they
have
such
an
eatabl
look
that
the
most
self

deni
stranger
can
hard
keep
his
hand
off
.
but
what
further
depreci
the
whale
as
a
civil
dish
,
is
his
exceed
rich
.
he
is
the
great
prize
ox
of
the
sea
,
too
fat
to
be
delic
good
.
look
at
his
hump
,
which
would
be
as
fine
eat
as
the
buffalo
'
s
(
which
is
esteem
a
rare
dish
),
were
it
not
such
a
solid
pyramid
of
fat
.
but
the
spermaceti
itself
,
how
bland
and
creami
that
is
;
like
the
transpar

half

jelli
,
white
meat
of
a
cocoanut
in
the
third
month
of
it
growth
,
yet
far
too
rich
to
suppli
a
substitut
for
butter
.
nevertheless
,
mani
whalemen
have
a
method
of
absorb
it
into
some
other
substanc
,
and
then
partak
of
it
.
in
the
long
tri
watch
of
the
night
it
is
a
common
thing
for
the
seamen
to
dip
their

a

supper
have
i
thus
made
.
in
the
case
of
a
small
sperm
whale
the
brain
are
account
a
fine
dish
.
the
casket
of
the
skull
is
broken
into
with
an
axe
,
and
the
two
plump
,
whitish
lobe
be
withdrawn
(
precis
resembl
two
larg
pud
),
they
are
then
mix
with
flour
,
and
cook
into
a
most
delect
mess
,
in
flavor
somewhat
resembl
calv

which
is
quit
a

that
is
the
reason
whi
a

befor
him

is
somehow
one
of
the

the

look
a

of
reproach

,
with
an

it
is
not

perhap
,
entir
becaus
the

is
so
excess
unctuous
that
landsmen
seem
to

that

no

the

man
that

perhap
he

the

i
have
given
no
small
attent
to
that
not
unvex
subject
,
the
skin
of
the
whale
.
i
have
had
controversi
about
it
with
experienc
whalemen
afloat
,
and
learn
naturalist
ashor
.
my
origin
opinion
remain
unchang
;
but
it
is
onli
an
opinion
.
the
question
is
,
what
and
where
is
the
skin
of
the
whale
?
alreadi
you
know
what
his
blubber
is
.
that
blubber
is
someth
of
the
consist
of
firm
,
close
-
grain
beef
,
but
tougher
,
more
elast
and
compact
,
and
rang
from
eight
or
ten
to
twelv
and
fifteen
inch
in
thick
.
now
,
howev
preposter
it
may
at
first
seem
to
talk
of
ani
creatur
'
s
skin
as
be
of
that
sort
of
consist
and
thick
,
yet
in
point
of
fact
these
are
no
argument
against
such
a
presumpt
;
becaus
you
cannot
rais
ani
other
dens
envelop
layer
from
the
whale
'
s
bodi
but
that
same
blubber
;
and
the
outermost
envelop
layer
of
ani
anim
,
if
reason
dens
,
what
can
that
be
but
the
skin
?
true
,
from
the
unmar
dead
bodi
of
the
whale
,
you
may
scrape
off
with
your
hand
an
infinit
thin
,
transpar
substanc
,
somewhat
resembl
the
thinnest
shred
of
isinglass
,
onli
it
is
almost
as
flexibl
and
soft
as

;
that
is
,
previous
to
be
dri
,
when
it
not
onli
contract
and
thicken
,
but
becom
rather
hard
and
brittl
.
i
have
sever
such
dri
bit
,
which
i
use
for
mark
in
my
whale
-
book
.
it
is
transpar
,
as
i
said
befor
;
and
be
laid
upon
the

,
i
have
sometim
pleas
myself
with

it

a
magnifi
influenc

at
ani
rate
,
it
is
pleasant
to
read
about
whale
through
their
own
spectacl
,
as
you
may
say
.
but
what
i
am
drive
at
here
is
this
.
that
same
infinit
thin
,
isinglass
substanc
,
which
,
i
admit
,
invest
the
entir
bodi
of
the
whale
,
is
not
so
much
to
be
regard
as
the
skin
of
the
creatur
,
as
the
skin
of
the
skin
,
so
to
speak
;
for
it
were
simpli
ridicul
to
say
,
that
the
proper
skin
of
the
tremend
whale
is
thinner
and
more
tender
than
the
skin
of
a
new
-
born
child
.
but
no
more
of
this
.
assum
the
blubber
to
be
the
skin
of
the
whale
;
then
,
when
this
skin
,
as
in
the
case
of
a
veri
larg
sperm
whale
,
will
yield
the
bulk
of
one
hundr
barrel
of
oil
;
and
,
when
it
is
consid
that
,
in
quantiti
,
or
rather
weight
,
that
oil
,
in
it
express
state
,
is
onli
three
fourth
,
and
not
the
entir
substanc
of
the
coat
;
some
idea
may
henc
be
had
of
the
enorm
of
that
anim
mass
,
a
mere
part
of
whose
mere
integu
yield
such

of

that

reckon
ten

to

you
have
ten

for
the
net
weight
of
onli
three
quarter
of
the
stuff
of
the
whale
'
s
skin
.
in
life
,
the
visibl
surfac
of
the
sperm
whale
is
not
the
least
among
the
mani
marvel
he
present
.
almost
invari
it
is
all
over
obliqu
cross

re

cross
with
numberless
straight
mark
in
thick

,
someth
like
those
in

but
these
mark
do
not
seem
to
be
impress
upon
the
isinglass
substanc
abov
mention
,
but
seem
to
be
seen
through
it
,
as
if
they
were
engrav
upon
the
bodi
itself
.
nor
is
this
all
.
in
some
instanc
,
to
the
quick
,
observ
eye
,
those
linear
mark
,
as
in
a
verit
engrav

but
afford
the
ground
for
far
other
delin

these
are
hieroglyph
;
that
is
,
if
you
call
those
mysteri
cypher
on
the
wall
of

hieroglyph
,
then
that
is
the
proper
word
to
use
in
the
present
connexion
.
by
my
retent
memori
of
the
hieroglyph
upon
one
sperm
whale
in
particular
,
i
was
much
struck
with
a
plate
repres
the
old

charact
chisel
on
the
famous
hieroglyph
palisad
on
the
bank
of
the
upper

like

too
,
the
mystic

whale
remain
undecipher
.
this
allus
to
the
indian
rock
remind
me
of
anoth
thing
.
besid
all
the
other
phenomena
which
the
exterior
of
the

present
,
he
not

,
and
more
especi

,
by
reason
of
numer
rude

altogeth
of
an
irregular

.
i
should
say
that
those
new

on

sea

coast
,
which
agassiz
imagin
to
bear
the
mark
of

--
i
should
say
,
that
those
rock
must
not
a
littl
resembl
the
sperm
whale
in
this
particular
.
it
also
seem
to
me
that
such
scratch
in
the

are
probabl
made
by
hostil
contact
with
other

;
for
i
have
most
remark
them

it
seem
that
the
scaramouch
in
question
had
gain
a
wonder
ascend
over
almost
everybodi
in
the
jeroboam
.
his
stori
was
this
:
he
had
been
origin
nurtur
among
the
crazi
societi
of
neskyeuna
shaker
,
where
he
had
been
a
great

;
in

crack

secret
meet
have
sever

descend
from
heaven
by
the
way
of
a
trap

door
,
announc
the
speedi
open
of
the
seventh
vial
,
which
he
carri
in
his

pocket
;
but
,
which
,
instead
of
contain
gunpowd
,
was
suppos
to
be
charg
with

.
a
strang
,
apostol
whim
have
seiz
him
,
he
had
left
neskyeuna
for
nantucket
,
where
,
with
that
cun
peculiar
to
crazi
,
he
assum
a
steadi

,
and
offer
himself
as
a
green
-
hand
candid
for
the
jeroboam
'
s
whale
voyag
.
they
engag
him
;
but
straightway
upon
the
ship
'
s
get
out
of
sight
of
land
,
his
insan
broke
out
in
a
freshet
.
he
announc
himself
as
the
archangel
gabriel
,
and
command
the
captain
to
jump
overboard
.
he
publish
his
manifesto
,
wherebi
he
set
himself
forth
as
the
deliver
of
the
isl
of
the
sea
and
vicar
-
general
of
all
oceanica
.
the
unflinch
earnest
with
which
he
declar
these
thing
;--
the
dark
,
dare
play
of
his
sleepless
,
excit
imagin
,
and
all
the
preternatur
terror
of
real
delirium
,
unit
to
invest
this
gabriel
in
the
mind
of
the
major
of
the
ignor
crew
,
with
an
atmospher
of
sacred
.
moreov
,
they
were
afraid
of
him
.
as
such
a
man
,
howev
,
was
not
of
much
practic
use
in
the
ship
,
especi
as
he
refus
to
work
except
when
he
pleas
,
the
incredul
captain
would
fain
have
been
rid
of
him
;
but
appris
that
that
individu
'
s
intent
was
to
land
him
in
the
first
conveni
port
,
the
archangel
forthwith
open
all
his
seal
and
vial
--
devot
the
ship
and
all
hand
to
uncondit
perdit
,
in
case
this
intent
was
carri
out
.
so
strong
did
he
work
upon
his
discipl
among
the
crew
,
that
at
last
in
a
bodi
they
went
to
the
captain
and
told
him
if
gabriel
was
sent
from
the
ship
,
not
a
man
of
them
would
remain
.
he
was
therefor
forc
to
relinquish
his
plan
.
nor
would
they
permit
gabriel
to
be
ani
way
maltreat
,
say
or
do
what
he
would
;
so
that
it
came
to
pass
that
gabriel
had
the
complet
freedom
of
the
ship
.
the
consequ
of
all
this
was
,
that
the
archangel
care
littl
or
noth
for
the
captain
and
mate
;
and
sinc
the
epidem
had
broken
out
,
he
carri
a
higher
hand
than
ever
;
declar
that
the
plagu
,
as
he
call
it
,
was
at
his
sole
command
;
nor
should
it
be

but

good
pleasur

befor
him
;
in
obedi
to
his
instruct
,
sometim
render
him
person
homag
,
as
to
a
god
.
such
thing
may
seem
incred
;
but
,
howev
wondrous
,
they
are
true
.
nor
is
the
histori
of
fanat
half
so
strike
in
respect
to
the
measureless
self
-
decept
of
the
fanat
himself
,
as
his
measureless
power
of
deceiv

but
it
is
time
to
return
to

"

contrast

here
,
now
,
are
two
great
whale
,
lay
their
head
togeth
;
let
us
join
them
,
and
lay
togeth
our
own
.
of
the
grand
order
of
folio
leviathan
,
the
sperm
whale
and
the
right
whale
are
by
far
the
most
noteworthi
.
they
are
the
onli
whale
regular
hunt
by
man
.
to
the
nantucket
,
they
present
the
two
extrem
of
all
the
known
varieti
of
the
whale
.
as
the
extern
differ
between
them
is
main
observ
in
their
head
;
and
as
a
head
of
each
is
this
moment
hang
from
the
pequod
'
s
side
;
and
as
we
may
freeli
go
from
one
to
the
other
,
by
mere
step
across
the
deck
:--
where
,
i
should
like
to
know
,
will
you
obtain
a
better
chanc
to
studi
practic
cetolog
than
here
?
in
the
first
place
,
you
are
struck
by
the
general
contrast
between
these
head
.
both
are
massiv
enough
in
all
conscienc
;
but
there
is
a
certain
mathemat
symmetri
in
the
sperm
whale
'
s
which
the
right
whale
'
s
sad
lack
.
there
is
more
charact
in
the
sperm
whale
'
s
head
.
as
you
behold
it
,
you
involuntarili
yield
the
immens
superior
to
him
,
in
point
of
pervad
digniti
.
in
the
present
instanc
,
too
,
this
digniti
is
heighten
by
the
pepper
and
salt
colour
of
his
head
at
the
summit
,
give
token
of
advanc
age
and
larg
experi
.
in
short
,
he
is
what
the
fishermen
technic
call
a
"
grey
-
head
whale
."
let
us
now
note
what
is
least
dissimilar
in
these
head
--
name
,
the
two
most
import
organ
,
the
eye
and
the
ear
.
far
back
on
the
side
of
the
head
,
and
low
down
,
near
the
angl
of
either
whale
'
s
jaw
,
if
you
narrowli
search
,
you
will
at
last
see
a
lashless
eye
,
which
you
would
fanci
to
be
a
young
colt
'
s
eye
;
so
out
of
all
proport
is
it
to
the
magnitud
of
the
head
.
now
,
from
this
peculiar
sideway
posit
of
the
whale
'
s
eye
,
it
is
plain
that
he
can
never
see
an
object
which
is
exact
ahead
,
no
more
than
he
can
one
exact
astern
.
in
a
word
,
the
posit
of
the
whale
'
s
eye
correspond
to
that
of
a
man
'
s
ear
;
and
you
may
fanci
,
for
yourself
,
how
it
would
fare
with
you
,
did
you
sideway
survey
object
through
your
ear
.
you
would
find
that
you
could
onli
command
some
thirti
degre
of
vision
in
advanc
of
the
straight
side
-
line
of
sight
;
and
about
thirti
more
behind
it
.
if
your
bitterest
foe
were
walk
straight
toward
you
,
with
dagger
uplift
in
broad
day
,
you
would
not
be
abl
to
see
him
,
ani
more
than
if
he
were
steal
upon
you
from
behind
.
in
a
word
,
you
would
have
two
back
,
so
to
speak
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
also
,
two
front
(
side
front
):
for
what
is
it
that
make
the
front
of
a
man
--
what
,
inde
,
but
his
eye
?
moreov
,
while
in
most
other
anim
that
i
can
now
think
of
,
the
eye
are
so
plant
as
impercept
to
blend
their
visual
power
,
so
as
to
produc
one
pictur
and
not
two
to
the
brain
;
the
peculiar
posit
of
the
whale
'
s
eye
,
effectu
divid
as
they
are
by
mani
cubic
feet
of
solid
head
,
which
tower
between
them
like
a
great
mountain
separ
two
lake
in
valley
;
this
,
of
cours
,
must
wholli
separ
the
impress
which
each
independ
organ
impart
.
the
whale
,
therefor
,
must
see
one
distinct
pictur
on
this
side
,
and
anoth
distinct
pictur
on
that
side
;
while
all
between
must
be
profound
dark
and
nothing
to
him
.
man
may
,
in
effect
,
be
said
to
look
out
on
the
world
from
a
sentri
-
box
with
two
join
sash
for
his
window
.
but
with
the
whale
,
these
two
sash
are
separ
insert
,
make
two
distinct
window
,
but
sad
impair
the
view
.
this
peculiar
of
the
whale
'
s
eye
is
a
thing
alway
to
be
born
in
mind
in
the
fisheri
;
and
to
be
rememb
by
the
reader
in
some
subsequ
scene
.
a
curious
and
most
puzzl
question
might
be
start
concern
this
visual
matter
as
touch
the
leviathan
.
but
i
must
be
content
with
a
hint
.
so
long
as
a
man
'
s
eye
are
open
in
the
light
,
the
act
of
see
is
involuntari
;
that
is
,
he
cannot
then
help
mechan
see
whatev
object
are
befor
him
.
nevertheless
,
ani
one
'
s
experi
will
teach
him
,
that
though
he
can
take
in
an
undiscrimin
sweep
of
thing
at
one
glanc
,
it
is
quit
imposs
for
him
,
attent
,
and
complet
,
to
examin
ani
two
thing
--
howev
larg
or
howev
small
--
at
one
and
the
same
instant
of
time
;
never
mind
if
they
lie
side
by
side
and
touch
each
other
.
but
if
you
now
come
to
separ
these
two
object
,
and
surround
each
by
a
circl
of
profound
dark
;
then
,
in
order
to
see
one
of
them
,
in
such
a
manner
as
to
bring
your
mind
to
bear
on
it
,
the
other
will
be
utter
exclud
from
your
contemporari
conscious
.
how
is
it
,
then
,
with
the
whale
?
true
,
both
his
eye
,
in
themselv
,
must
simultan
act
;
but
is
his
brain
so
much
more
comprehens
,
combin
,
and
subtl
than
man
'
s
,

as
if

nor

strict

is
there
ani
incongru
in
this
comparison
.
it
may
be
but
an
idl
whim
,
but
it
has
alway
seem
to
me
,
that
the
extraordinari
vacil
of
movement
display
by
some
whale
when
beset
by
three
or
four
boat
;
the
timid
and
liabil
to
queer
fright
,
so
common
to
such
whale
;
i
think
that
all
this
indirect
proceed
from
the
helpless
perplex
of
volit
,
in
which
their
divid
and
diametr
opposit
power
of
vision
must
involv
them
.
but
the
ear
of
the
whale
is
full
as
curious
as
the
eye
.
if
you
are
an
entir
stranger
to
their
race
,
you
might
hunt
over
these
two
head
for
hour
,
and
never
discov
that
organ
.
the
ear
has
no
extern
leaf
whatev
;
and
into
the
hole
itself
you
can
hard
insert
a
quill
,
so
wondrous
minut
is
it
.
it
is
lodg
a
littl
behind
the
eye
.
with
respect
to
their
ear
,
this
import
differ
is
to
be
observ
between
the
sperm
whale
and
the
right
.
while
the
ear
of
the
former
has
an
extern
open
,
that
of
the
latter
is
entir
and
even
cover
over
with
a
membran
,
so
as
to
be
quit
impercept
from
without
.
is
it
not
curious
,
that
so
vast
a
be
as
the
whale
should
see
the
world
through
so
small
an
eye
,
and
hear
the
thunder
through
an
ear
which
is
smaller
than
a
hare

?
but
if
his
eye
were
broad
as
the
len
of

and
his
ear
capaci
as

would
that
make
him

of

or
sharper
of

ascend

it
to

you

you

that

no

again

the

the

look

can
you

it

onli
some

let
no

this

for
in

on

in

stood
for

the

what
seem

is
this
:
it

from

one

whaleman
'
s
chief
reason
for
question
the

was
this
:--
he
had
one
of

quaint

embellish
with

unscientif
plate
;
one
of

repres
jonah

with

--
a
peculiar
onli
true
with
respect
to
a
speci
of
the
leviathan
(
the
right

,
and
the
varieti
of

concern
which
the
fishermen
have
this
say
,
"
a

his

,
to

it

hint
the

that

as

this
seem
reason
enough
in

good

accommod

possibl

too
,
jonah
might
have
ensconc
himself
in
a
hollow
tooth
;
but
,
on
second
thought
,
the
right
whale
is
toothless
.
anoth
reason
which
sag

he
went
by

for

want

someth
obscur
in

but
this
object
likewis
fall
to
the
ground
,
becaus
a
german
exegetist
suppos
that
jonah
must
have
taken
refug
in

--
even
as
the
french

into

besid
,
it
has
been
divin
by
other

comment
,
that
when
jonah
was
thrown
overboard
from

joppa

he
straightway
effect

mere
meant
a
life

preserv

an
inflat

of

which
the
endang
prophet
swam
to
,
and
so
was
save
from
a
wateri
doom
.
poor
sag

harbor
,
therefor
,
seem
worst
all
round
.
but
he
had
still
anoth
reason
for
his
want
of
faith
.
it
was
this
,
if
i
rememb
right
:
jonah
was
swallow
by
the
whale
in
the
mediterranean
sea
,
and
after
three
day
he
was
vomit
up
somewher

veri
much
more
than

journey
across
from

nearest
point
of

mediterranean
coast

how
is
that
?
but
was
there
no
other
way
for
the
whale
to
land
the
prophet
within
that
short
distanc
of
nineveh
?
yes
.
he
might
have
carri
him
round
by
the
way
of
the
cape

but
not
to
speak
of
the
passag
through

such
a

not

whether

this
is

let
us
,
then
,
look
at
this

,
along

some
interest

everi

at

a

might
live
a

and
never

but
owe
to

give
him

like

the

but
he

,
in

,
the

'
s
mouth
is
buri
at

eight
feet
beneath
the

;
and
what
is
still
more
,
his
windpip
has
no
connexion
with
his
mouth
.
no
,
he
breath
through
his
spiracl

;
and
this
is
on
the
top
of
his
head
.
if
i
say
,
that
in

is
onli
a
function
indispens

vital
,
inasmuch

it

assum
it
,
and
it
follow
that
if
all
the
blood
in
a
man
could
be
aerat
with
one
breath
,
he
might
then
seal
up
his
nostril
and
not
fetch
anoth
for
a
consider
time
.
that
is
to
say
,
he
would
then
live
without
breath
.
anomal
as
it
may
seem
,
this
is
precis
the
case
with
the
whale
,
who
systemat
live
,
by
interv
,
his
full
hour
and
more
(
when
at

)
without

so
much
as
in

inhal
a

;
for
,
rememb
,
he
has
no

.
how
is
this
?
between
his
rib
and
on
each
side
of
his
spine
he
is
suppli
with
a
remark
involv

labyrinth
of

-
like

,
which
vessel
,
when
he
quit

.
so
that
for
an
hour
or
more
,
a
thousand
fathom
in
the
sea
,
he
carri
a
surplus
stock
of
vital
in
him
,
just
as
the
camel

waterless

a
surplus

the
anatom

of
this
labyrinth
is
indisput
;
and
that
the
supposit
found
upon
it
is
reason
and
true
,

this
is
what
i

if

the

will
continu

he

to

now
,
if
after

a

you

,
so
that

he
will
be
alway

to

,

unless
it
be

that

the

it
has
been
said
that
the

;
if
it
could
truth
be
ad
that
his

,
then
i
opin
we
should
be
furnish
with
the
reason
whi
his

seem

;
for
the
onli
thing
about

that

;
and
be
so
clog
with

element
,
it
could
not
be
expect
to
have
the
power
of

.
but
owe
to
the
mysteri
of
the
spout
--
whether
it
be
water
or
whether
it
be
vapour
--
no
absolut
certainti
can
as
yet
be
arriv
at
on
this
head
.
sure
it
is
,
nevertheless
,
that
the
sperm
whale
has
no
proper
olfactori
.
but
what
doe
he
want
of
them
?
no
rose
,
no
violet
,
no

water
in

sea
.
furthermor
,
as
his
windpip
sole
open
into
the
tube
of
his
spout
canal
,
and
as
that
long
canal
--
like
the
grand
eri
canal
--
is
furnish
with
a
sort
of
lock
(
that
open
and
shut
)
for
the
downward
retent
of
air
or
the
upward
exclus
of
water
,
therefor
the
whale
has
no
voic
;
unless
you
insult
him
by
say
,
that
when
he
so
strang
rumbl
,
he
talk
through
his
nose
.
but
then
again
,
what
has
the
whale
to
say
?
seldom
have
i
known
ani
profound
be
that
had
anyth
to
say
to
this
world
,
unless
forc
to
stammer
out
someth
by
way
of

live
.
oh
!
happi
that
the
world
is
such
an
excel
listen
!
now
,
the
spout
canal
of
the
sperm
whale
,
chiefli
intend
as
it
is
for
the
convey
of
air
,
and
for
sever
feet
laid
along
,
horizont
,
just
beneath
the
upper
surfac
of
his
head
,
and
a
littl
to
one
side
;
this
curious
canal
is
veri
much
like
a
gas
-
pipe
laid
down
in
a
citi
on
one
side
of
a
street
.
but
the
question
return
whether
this
gas
-
pipe
is
also
a
water
-
pipe
;
in
other
word
,
whether
the
spout
of
the
sperm
whale
is
the
mere
vapour
of
the
exhal
breath
,
or
whether
that
exhal
breath
is
mix
with
water
taken
in
at
the
mouth
,
and
discharg
through
the
spiracl
.
it
is
certain
that
the
mouth
indirect
communic
with
the
spout
canal
;
but
it
cannot
be
prove
that
this
is
for
the
purpos
of
discharg
water
through
the
spiracl
.
becaus
the
greatest
necess
for
so
do
would
seem
to
be
,
when
in
feed
he
accident
take
in
water
.
but
the
sperm
whale
'
s
food
is
far
beneath
the
surfac
,
and
there
he
cannot
spout
even
if
he
would
.
besid
,
if
you
regard
him
veri
close
,
and
time
him
with
your
watch
,
you
will
find
that
when
unmolest
,
there
is
an
undevi
rhyme
between
the
period
of
his
jet
and
the
ordinari
period
of
respir
.
but
whi
pester
one
with
all
this
reason
on
the
subject
?
speak
out
!
you
have
seen
him
spout
;
then
declar
what
the
spout
is
;
can
you
not
tell
water
from
air
?
my
dear
sir
,
in
this
world
it
is
not
so
easi
to
settl
these
plain
thing
.
i
have
ever
found
your
plain
thing
the
knottiest
of
all
.
and
as
for
this
whale
spout
,
you
might
almost
stand
in
it
,
and
yet
be
undecid
as
to
what
it
is
precis
.
the
central
bodi
of
it
is
hidden
in
the
snowi
sparkl
mist
envelop
it
;
and
how
can
you
certain
tell
whether
ani
water
fall
from
it
,
when
,
alway
,
when
you
are
close
enough
to
a
whale
to
get
a

we

my

this

that

by

i
account

no

inasmuch

it
is
an

that

never

;
all

he
is
both

and
i
am
convinc
that
from

of
all

such
as

this

third
:
i

it
seem
to
me
,
that
in

the

there
is

had
this

i
should
straightway

with

then
caress

on
more
account
than
one
,
a
piti
it
is
that
the

doe
not

for
i

fourth
:
steal
unawar

in
the

you
find
him
unbent

he

but
still
you
see
his

the

of

flirt
high

then
smite

you

think
that

fifth
:
as
in
the

of
the

the
fluke
lie
consider
below
the
level
of
his

,
they
are

complet

but
when

about

his

with
at

thirti

of

so
remain

till

except

this

perhap
the

to

out

but
in

at

it
is
all
in

what

you
are
in
;
if
in

all

,
and
for
a

vibrat
in
concert
with
peak

as
it
seem
to
me
at
the

,
such
a
grand
embodi
of

of

never
beheld

even

pronounc
him
the

for

,
the

eleph
of

often
hail
the

in

the
chanc
comparison
in
this
chapter
,
between
the
whale
and
the
eleph
,
so
far
as
some
aspect
of
the
tail
of
the
one
and
the
trunk
of
the
other
are
concern
,
should
not
tend
to
place
those
two
opposit
organ
on
an
equal
,
much
less
the
creatur
to
which
they
respect
belong
.
for
as
the
mightiest
eleph
is
but
a
terrier
to
leviathan
,
so
,
compar
with
leviathan
'
s
tail
,
his
trunk
is
but
the
stalk
of
a
lili
.
the
most
dire
blow
from
the
eleph
'
s
trunk
were
as
the
play
tap
of

,
compar
with
the
measureless
crush

of

,
which
in
repeat
instanc
have
one
after

other
hurl
entir
boat
with
all
their
oar
and
crew
into
the
air
,
veri
much
as
an
indian
juggler
toss
his

.*
*
though
all
comparison
in
the
way
of
general
bulk
between
the
whale
and
the
eleph
is
preposter
,
inasmuch
as
in
that
particular
the
eleph
stand
in
much
the
same
respect
to
the
whale
that
a
dog
doe
to
the
eleph
;
nevertheless
,
there
are
not
want
some
point
of

it

are

at

one

after

,
the

his

think
that
view
in

the

might
by
a
bare
possibl
in
some
small

be
deem
,
under

a

an

address
a

him

to

my

repli
(

that
he
had
alreadi
done

on

it
will
readili
be
seen
that
in
this
case
the
alleg
right
of
the
duke
to
the

was
a
deleg
one
from
the

we
must

inquir

the

us
the

say
plowdon
,
the
whale
so
caught
belong
to
the
king
and
queen
,
"
becaus
of
it
superior
excel
."
and
by
the
soundest
comment
this
has
ever
been
held
a
cogent
argument
in
such
matter
.
but
whi
should
the
king
have
the
head
,
and
the
queen
the
tail
?
a
reason
for
that
,
ye
lawyer
!
in
his
treatis
on
"
queen
-
gold
,"
or
queen
-
pinmoney
,
an
old
king
'
s
bench
author
,
one
william
prynn
,
thus
discourseth
:
"
ye
tail
is
ye
queen
'
s
,
that
ye
queen
'
s
wardrob
may
be
suppli
with
ye
whalebon
."
now
this
was
written
at
a
time
when
the
black
limber
bone
of
the
greenland
or
right
whale
was
larg
use
in
ladi
'
bodic
.
but
this
same
bone
is
not
in
the
tail
;
it
is
in
the
head
,
which
is
a
sad
mistak
for
a
sagaci
lawyer
like
prynn
.
but
is
the
queen
a
mermaid
,
to
be
present
with
a
tail
?
an
allegor
mean
may
lurk
here
.
there
are
two
royal
fish
so
style
by
the
english
law
writer
--
the
whale
and
the
sturgeon
;
both
royal
properti
under
certain
limit
,
and
nomin
suppli
the
tenth
branch
of
the
crown
'
s
ordinari
revenu
.
i
know
not
that
ani
other
author
has
hint
of
the
matter
;
but
by
infer
it
seem
to
me
that
the
sturgeon
must
be
divid
in
the
same
way
as
the
whale
,
the
king
receiv
the
high
dens
and
elast
head
peculiar
to
that
fish
,
which
,
symbol
regard
,
may
possibl
be
humor
ground
upon
some
presum
congeni
.
and
thus
there
seem
a
reason
in
all
thing
,
even
in
law
.

ambergri
.
now
this
ambergri
is
a
veri
curious
substanc
,
and
so
import
as
an
articl
of
commerc
,
that
in
1791
a
certain
nantucket
-
born
captain
coffin
was
examin
at
the
bar
of
the
english
hous
of
common
on
that
subject
.
for
at
that
time
,
and
inde
until
a
compar
late
day
,
the
precis
origin
of
ambergri
remain
,
like
amber
itself
,
a
problem
to
the
learn
.
though
the
word
ambergri
is
but
the
french
compound
for
grey
amber
,
yet
the
two
substanc
are
quit
distinct
.
for
amber
,
though
at
time
found
on
the
sea
-
coast
,
is
also
dug
up
in
some
far
inland
soil
,
wherea
ambergri
is
never
found
except
upon
the
sea
.
besid
,
amber
is
a
hard
,
transpar
,
brittl
,
odorless
substanc
,
use
for
mouth
-
piec
to
pipe
,
for
bead
and
ornament
;
but
ambergri
is
soft
,
waxi
,
and
so
high
fragrant
and
spici
,
that
it
is
larg
use
in
perfumeri
,
in
pastil
,
precious
candl
,
hair
-
powder
,
and
pomatum
.
the
turk
use
it
in
cook
,
and
also
carri
it
to
mecca
,
for
the
same
purpos
that
frankincens
is
carri
to
st
.
peter
'
s
in
rome
.
some
wine
merchant
drop
a
few
grain
into
claret
,
to
flavor
it
.
who
would
think
,
then
,
that
such
fine
ladi
and
gentlemen
should
regal
themselv
with
an
essenc
found
in
the
inglori
bowel
of
a
sick
whale
!
yet
so
it
is
.
by
some
,
ambergri
is
suppos
to
be
the
caus
,
and
by
other
the
effect
,
of
the
dyspepsia
in
the
whale
.
how
to
cure
such
a
dyspepsia
it
were
hard
to
say
,
unless
by
administ
three
or
four
boat
load
of
brandreth
'
s
pill
,
and
then
run
out
of
harm
'
s
way
,
as
labor
do
in
blast
rock
.
i
have
forgotten
to
say
that
there
were
found
in
this
ambergri
,
certain
hard
,
round
,
boni
plate
,
which
at
first
stubb
thought
might
be
sailor
'
trowser
button
;
but
it
afterward
turn
out
that
they
were
noth
more
than
piec
of
small
squid
bone
embalm
in
that
manner
.
now
that
the
incorrupt
of
this
most
fragrant
ambergri
should
be
found
in
the
heart
of
such
decay
;
is
this
noth
?
bethink
thee
of
that
say
of
st
.
paul
in
corinthian
,
about
corrupt
and
incorrupt
;
how
that
we
are
sown
in
dishonour
,
but
rais
in
glori
.
and
likewis
call
to
mind
that
say
of
paracelsus
about
what
it
is
that
maketh
the
best
musk
.
also
forget
not
the
strang
fact
that
of
all
thing
of
ill
-
savor
,
cologn
-
water
,
in
it
rudiment
manufactur
stage
,
is
the
worst
.
i
should
like
to
conclud
the
chapter
with
the
abov
appeal
,
but
cannot
,
owe
to
my
anxieti
to
repel
a
charg
often
made
against
whalemen
,
and
which
,
in
the
estim
of
some
alreadi
bias
mind
,
might
be
consid
as
indirect
substanti
by
what
has
been
said
of
the
frenchman
'
s
two
whale
.
elsewher
in
this
volum
the
slander
aspers
has
been
disprov
,
that
the
vocat
of
whale
is
throughout
a
slattern
,
untidi
busi
.
but
there
is
anoth
thing
to
rebut
.
they
hint
that
all
whale
alway
smell
bad
.
now
how
did
this
odious
stigma
origin
?
i
opin
,
that
it
is
plain
traceabl
to
the
first
arriv
of
the
greenland
whale
ship
in
london
,
more
than
two
centuri
ago
.
becaus
those
whalemen
did
not
then
,
and
do
not
now
,
tri
out
their
oil
at
sea
as
the
southern
ship
have
alway
done
;
but
cut
up
the
fresh
blubber
in
small
bit
,
thrust
it
through
the
bung
hole
of
larg
cask
,
and
carri
it
home
in
that
manner
;
the
short
of
the
season
in
those
ici
sea
,
and
the
sudden
and
violent
storm
to
which
they
are
expos
,
forbid
ani
other
cours
.
the
consequ
is
,
that
upon
break
into
the
hold
,
and
unload
one
of
these
whale
cemeteri
,
in
the
greenland
dock
,
a
savor
is
given
forth
somewhat
similar
to
that
aris
from
excav
an
old
citi
grave
-
yard
,
for
the
foundat
of
a
lie
-
in
-
hospit
.
i
part
surmis
also
,
that
this
wick
charg
against
whaler
may
be
likewis
imput
to
the
exist
on
the
coast
of
greenland
,
in
former
time
,
of
a
dutch
villag
call
schmerenburgh
or
smeerenberg
,
which
latter
name
is
the
one
use
by
the
learn

in
his
great

book
on
that
subject
.
as
it
name
import
(
smeer
,
fat

,
to
put
up
),
this
villag
was
found
in
order
to
afford
a
place
for
the
blubber
of
the
dutch
whale
fleet
to
be
tri
out
,
without
be
taken
home
to
holland
for
that
purpos
.
it
was
a
collect
of
furnac
,
fat
-
kettl
,
and
oil
shed
;
and
when
the
work
were
in
full
oper
certain
gave
forth
no
veri
pleasant
savor
.
but
all
this
is
quit
differ
with
a
south

sperm

;
which
in
a
voyag
of

year
perhap

of

;
and
in
the
state
that
it
is

,
the

near

.
the
truth
is
,
that
live
or
dead

if
but

,

as
a

by
no

nor

can

when

as

alway
out

though
,
it
is

i

,
that

in

this

the

for

the

with

no

but
now
it

it
look
much

there
are
forti

odd

in

the

,
where
the

taper

is
onli
two

look
someth
like

i
was
told
that
there
were

they
had

it

no

the

if
ever
i

i
,
a
whaleman
(
more
than
he
was
),
will
make
bold
to
tell
him
so
.
becaus
i
cannot
understand
how
it
is
,
that
while
the
egyptian
mummi

were
buri
thousand
of

befor
even
plini
was

,
do
not
measur
so

in
the
face
of
all
this
,
i
will
not
admit
that
of

the

should
have
degener

still
anoth
inquiri
remain

the
moot
point
is
,
whether

can

a

whether
he
must
not
at

was
it
that
this
old
carpent
had
been
a
life
-
long
wander
,
whose
much
roll
,
to
and
fro
,
not
onli
had
gather
no
moss
;
but
what
is
more
,
had
rub
off
whatev
small
outward
cling
might
have
origin
pertain
to
him
?
he
was
a
stript
abstract
;
an
unfract
integr
;
uncompromis
as
a
new
-
born
babe
;
live
without
premedit
refer
to
this
world
or
the
next
.
you
might
almost
say
,
that
this
strang
uncompromised
in
him
involv
a
sort
of
unintellig
;
for
in
his
numer
trade
,
he
did
not
seem
to
work
so
much
by
reason
or
by
instinct
,
or
simpli
becaus
he
had
been
tutor
to
it
,
or
by
ani
intermixtur
of
all
these
,
even
or
uneven
;
but
mere
by
a
kind
of
deaf
and
dumb
,
spontan
liter
process
.
he
was
a
pure
manipul
;
his
brain
,
if
he
had
ever
had
one
,
must
have
earli
ooz
along
into
the
muscl
of
his
finger
.
he
was
like
one
of
those
unreason
but
still
high
use

a

driver
,
cork

tweezer
,

so
,
if
his
superior
want
to
use
the
carpent
for
a
screw
-
driver
,
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
open
that
part
of
him
,
and
the
screw
was
fast
:
or
if
for
tweezer
,
take
him
up
by
the
leg
,
and
there
they
were
.
yet
,
as
previous
hint
,
this
omnitool
,
open
-
and
-
shut
carpent
,
was
,
after
all
,
no
mere
machin
of
an
automaton
.
if
he
did
not
have
a
common
soul
in
him
,
he
had
a
subtl
someth
that
somehow
anomal
did
it
duti

what
that
was
,
whether
essenc
of
quicksilv
,
or
a
few
drop
of

there
is
no
tell
.
but
there
it
was
;
and
there
it
had
abid
for
now
some
sixti
year
or
more
.
and
this
it
was
,
this
same
unaccount

cun

principl
in
him
;
this
it
was
,
that
kept

but
onli
like
an
unreason

which
also
hum

rather
,
his

was
a

of

the

declar
that
the
wild
thrill
sound
that
were
heard
,
were
the
voic
of
newli

in

below
in

,
ahab
did
not
hear
of
this
till
grey
dawn
,
when
he
came
to
the

;
it
was
then
recount
to
him
by
flask
,
not
unaccompani
with
hint
dark
mean
.
he
hollowli
laugh
,
and
thus
explain
the
wonder
.
those
rocki
island
the
ship
had
pass
were
the
resort
of
great
number
of
seal
,
and
some
young
seal
that
had
lost
their
dam
,
or
some
dam
that
had
lost
their
cub
,
must
have
risen
nigh
the
ship
and
kept
compani
with
her
,
cri
and
sob
with
their
human
sort
of
wail
.
but
this
onli
the
more
affect
some
of
them
,
becaus
most
marin
cherish
a
veri
superstiti
feel
about
seal
,
aris
not
onli
from
their
peculiar
tone
when
in
distress
,
but
also
from
the
human
look
of
their
round
head
and
semi
-
intellig
face
,
seen
peer
upris
from
the
water
alongsid
.
in

,
under

seal
have
more
than
onc
been

but
the
bode
of
the
crew
were
destin
to
receiv
a
most
plausibl
confirm
in
the
fate
of
one
of
their
number
that
morn
.
at
sun
-
rise
this
man
went
from
his
hammock
to
his
mast
-
head
at
the
fore
;
and
whether
it
was
that
he
was
not
yet
half
wake
from
his
sleep
(
for
sailor

go
aloft
in
a
transit

),
whether
it
was
thus
with
the
man
,
there
is
now
no
tell
;
but
,
be
that
as
it
may
,
he
had
not
been
long
at
his
perch
,
when
a
cri
was
heard
--
a
cri
and
a
rush
--
and
look
up
,
they
saw
a
fall
phantom
in
the
air
;
and
look
down
,
a
littl
toss
heap
of
white
bubbl
in
the
blue
of
the
sea
.
the
life
-
buoy
--
a
long
slender
cask
--
was
drop
from
the
stern
,
where
it
alway
hung
obedi
to
a
cun
spring
;
but
no
hand
rose
to
seiz
it
,
and
the
sun
have
long
beat
upon
this
cask
it
had
shrunken
,
so
that
it
slowli
fill
,
and
that
parch
wood
also
fill
at
it
everi
pore
;
and
the
stud
iron

bound
cask
follow
the
sailor
to
the
bottom
,
as
if
to
yield
him
his
pillow
,
though
in
sooth
but
a
hard
one
.
and
thus
the
first
man
of
the
pequod
that
mount
the
mast
to
look
out
for
the
white
whale
,
on
the
white
whale
'
s
own
peculiar
ground
;
that
man
was
swallow
up
in
the
deep
.
but
few
,
perhap
,
thought
of
that
at
the
time
.
inde
,
in
some
sort
,
they
were
not
griev
at
this
event
,
at
least
as
a
portent
;
for
they
regard
it
,
not
as
a
foreshadow
of
evil
in
the
futur
,
but
as
the
fulfil
of
an
evil
alreadi
presag
.
they
declar
that
now
they
knew
the
reason
of
those
wild
shriek
they
had
heard
the
night
befor
.
but
again
the
old
manxman
said
nay

the
lost

now
to
be

starbuck
was
direct
to

as

somewhat

then
settl

then
arrang

the

secur

thus

with

the

seem

it
was
strang

that
this

give

now

the

dart
a

straight
up

then
spiral
downward

went

round

but
with

ahab
