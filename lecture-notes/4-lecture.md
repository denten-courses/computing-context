### Lecture Notes

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index):

> automated readability index (ARI) is a readability test designed to gauge
the understandability of a text. Like the Flesch–Kincaid grade level, Gunning fog
index, SMOG index, Fry readability formula, and Coleman–Liau index, it
produces an approximate representation of the US grade level needed to
comprehend the text.
>
> The formula for calculating the automated readability index is given below:
>
> (4.71 * charachters/words) + (0.5 * words/sentences) - 21.43
>
> where characters is the number of letters and numbers, words is the number of
spaces, and sentences is the number of sentences.
>
> As a rough guide, US grade level 1 corresponds to ages 6–8. Reading level
grade 8 corresponds to the typical reading level of a 14-year-old US child.
Grade 12, the highest US secondary-school grade before college, corresponds to
the reading level of a 17-year-old. paragraph parser length of sentences and paragraphs.

# can you see some problems with the above definition?
# lets try to replicate the formula!

words = 
chars = 
sents =
