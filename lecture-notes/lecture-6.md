## Where to go from here?

1. Take control of your computing environment, starting with your daily writing
and computation. "If you have to do it more than ~~once~~ one hundred times,
automate it." Writing, research, self-presentation.

2. Some of my favorite books in Computer Science for beginners.<sup>1,</sup><sup>2,</sup><sup>3,</sup><sup>4,</sup><sup>5</sup>
