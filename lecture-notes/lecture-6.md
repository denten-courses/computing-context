## Where to go from here?

### Take control of your computing environment 

Start with your daily writing and computation. "If you have to do it more than
~~once~~ *100* times, automate it." Writing, research, self-presentation.

### Challenges:
- write a paper in [Pandoc +
  Markdown](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown)
- put a project up on [GitHub](http://gitimmersion.com/)
- Make a [website](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- Keep a [logbook](https://github.com/denten/dhnotes/wiki).

### Notes

1. Programming is a mindset.
2. Unless you plan to become a professional programmer, think of it as the
"special sauce." It will enhance any other field of activity, from making to
music to being lawyer or a physician.
3. Refuse blackboxes.
4. Small things matter.
